SATISFACTION in a glorious Settlement School past and recognition of a needed and constructive present program, is not enough for a deter-mined, intelligent organization. For an answer to all your questions regarding the wise direction of our Settlement School welfare program, watch for an authoritative analysis in your December ARROW. We are proud of our success. We are not ashamed of our failures. It took both to build the substantial contribution to human betterment that Pi Phi Settlement School now represents. In the heart of every Pi Phi is the wish to preserve the qualities of service that we cherish most, a unified effort to raise the level of an entire community, an effort which in turn reacts to the perpetuation or Pi Phi ideals, Pi Phi strength, Pi Phi's growth. Throughout the ages, the trial and error method has prevailed as a basic test of separating truth from falsehood. It is indeed a tribute to Pi Phi's sound principles and wise planning that the success of our pioneer aims has had so few interruptions and so few detours as community need was measured. Changes in the application of our program, if wisely planned and executed, should cause no disruption to a smooth-running community service. We have moved so gradually into ever widening fields that both Pi Phi and the community have scarcely been aware of the transitions of the past thirty-two years. Today, news of the definite relinquishment to the County of further responsibility of the first six grades of the elementary school will create no community unrest, and will be welcomed by the conscientious far-seeing members of the community, for it has always been their desire to accept their own responsibilities when possible. Satisfaction will be felt by those progressive Pi Phis who for some years have agreed that we should relinquish this field. Our brain child has grown up; we must give it responsibility and let it try its own wings to prove whether our guidance has been true or false. There is agreement among even the most sentimental and conservative alumnae whose reluctance to give up this department has been based upon the understandable desire to preserve the intimate influence in the homes that this elementary school work has allowed. With mingled emotions of satisfaction and regret, Pi Phi will accept the news that official written notification has been given to the SEVIER COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD that we will with-draw assistance in the first six grades at the close of school 1943 as a natural outcome of a service well planned a proof that we have made progress in our aim to make our community self-supporting. This step is insurance that we May concentrate upon obligations that have been' increasing rather than diminishing. Growing population, education, and economic advancement, combine in challenging Pi Phis to redouble their efforts as the self-elected sponsor of an entire community. Can we stand success? Are we big enough to enlarge our perspective? To you, loyal Pi Phis, who have enjoyed hard work together and felt the thrill of satisfaction in seeing far-reaching results, we are sure that you are ready to face the conditions resulting from your sacrifice and labor. We are sure that you wish to capitalize upon your investment. We know that you wish to increase the dividends by renewed effort to build for the future upon foundations so strong and sturdy, keeping alive roots ,so deep and far-reaching. Every Pi Phi has a valued opinion, a personal and sincere desire. The sum total of 33,000 desires will determine the trend of our future service. The value of unified national effort has been so well demonstrated that there is a unanimous will to pre-serve strength through a centralized service. End-less are the channels through which we could give needed service. Almost any unselfish impulse and personal choice would result in constructive effort. It is a recognized fact that our foundations in the Smokies are so deep, our material plant and resources so adequate and flexible, the location so desirable, that Pi Phi can adapt this setup to any use determined by changing need and Pi Phi national viewpoint. Every Pi Phi admits proudly that we have not been standing still. Your committee admits confidently that there is need of the present service with its administration in line with currently suggested improvements. In addition to a serious consideration of the present, your committees have been struggling for years to keep ahead of the times in anticipation of future needs. While you worked and your committees interpreted your wishes in administering the details of a progressively sound service, there has been laid quietly a foundation. The pattern has been set for a coming broader achievement. Just when and how and why this pattern evolved itself into a certain compelling groove, we do not attempt to explain. Firm in the minds of those close to the situation, is the conviction that a greater opportunity lies ahead for Pi Phi, if we will heed the suggestions of this pattern. It is not news that your committee sees the future of our children. our youth and adults, in terms of planting the seeds and nourishing the development of an appreciation of form, color and design. We see for this reason a future of individual and collective opportunity to maintain themselves in ever-growing dignity by means of production of handicrafts of a superior quality. These products must be acceptable to the discriminating traveling public brought to this region by the lavish gifts of nature and the miracle of good roads. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW By supplying an ever-widening field in vocai.onal guidance, based upon an awakening to ,eauty of form and color, a whole community can ;radually make for itself a national center for de-.elopment of arts and crafts. Before interpreting too fully in terms of commitee deductions, we want you to know of a plan hat has been under way for years to compile factual roof of the humanitarian and educational value of hese tangible and intangible trends. Your committees have made every possible tudy preliminary to a factual survey from outide, unbiased, non Pi Phi authorities. You will understand our wish to have verificaion of or proof against certain trends; a desire or professional and experienced advice as to the .pplication of Pi Phi welfare service, not only in terms of need but in terms of whether the need justifies Pi Phi aid. You will welcome with us the authoritative and comprehensive survey regarding the soundness of the claim of a persistently challenging opportunity to expand our influence and create a new and satisfying future for the people of the Appalachian Mountains. Look for word of this in the December ARROW. Your committee welcomes and invites your suggestions, your opinions and your heartfelt wishes. Mutual enjoyment in sharing a great responsibility has given us a past of which we are proud. Mutual agreement and determination will build for us a happy future of greater service. ETHEL H. Cop?, Chairman Settlement School Committee. 'HUME OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE MEETING, 1941 THE MEMBERS of the II B 1 Settlement School Committee met for the annual meeting at the ,ettlement School from June 20 to June 28, 1941, vith three sessions a day. After an official welcome, specially of the new members, Agnes Spring and .olita Prouty, by Ethel Copp, the assignment of uties followed: Chairman, Ethel Copp. Treasurer, Irene Eldridge. Secretary Ways and Means, Lolita Prouty. Films and Publicity, Beth Le Roy. News from Little Pigeon, Agnes Spring. The Manual and the minutes of the 1940 meetig were read, followed by reports and recomiendations of committee and staff members. All !commendations were discussed and considered. Besides administrative problems, the Committee ttempted a survey of the community as to what :ley think of our project, and also a survey of the eeds of the community in regard to our future olicy. Marie Hagee, chairman for the past year, ras able to be present ex-officio at the request of to Committee with her invaluable assistance for lost of the sessions. Amy B. Onken, the Contactrith-Grand-Council-Member of the Committee for to year 1940-41, added her wealth of experience ad information for four days, during two of rhich all of Grand Council met with the Cornlittee. Among matters discussed with Grand Council ere: 1. A tentative physical plan of our development including discussions of: a. The giving over of the elementary school to the county. b. The new Stuart Cottage. c. A new Health Center. d. A new water system. e. A new gymnasium. 2. A discussion of the Wages and Hours Act. Miss Winogene Redding, weaving super-visor, reported on this and how it may affect our Arrowcraft industry if hand-loom weaving is not given exemption. 3. A consideration of the recommendations made by the Committee. The Committee felt it a special privilege to have le opportunity of personal discussion with Grand Council and hopes that it may serve the Fraternity more efficiently in the solution of the future trend of our project because of the exchange and comparison of ideas. Both the Committee and Grand Council felt we should know whether we are doing the right thing at the Settlement School and if not, what we should be doing, so definite plans were made for obtaining professional advice for the continued survey of needs and future trends of the Settlement School project. It was agreed to relinquish the first six years of the Elementary School to the County at the end of the school year 1942-43. In the discussion of this motion it was brought out that the County is able now to take over the School and at the present time has been paying us $125.00 a month for rent of the building and all the salaries of the elementary teachers. Since our building and equipment is becoming obsolete it would be necessary to build a new building if we kept the school much longer. The contracts were let for the construction, heating, wiring, and plumbing of the new Stuart Building at a cost of $8,600.00. A new Crafts teacher was hired, and special emphasis is to be put on that phase of work next year. An effort was made to secure a music teacher through the University of Tennessee and the W.P.A. music director by supplementing the salary of someone recommended by them. Among motions passed dealing with other matters were: That the discount allowed to alumni clubs on Arrowcraft orders be increased from 15 per cent to 20 per cent. That a safe reserve of Arrowcraft funds be maintained for Arrowcraft use. That the entire cost of the new boys' dormitory including the architect's fees be kept within the bequest of Anne Stuart, i.e., $9,200.00. That Bigridge and McCookville schools be turned back to the County for health supervision if after a conference with County officials, the Chairman thinks is advisable. That the budget for publicity be increased in order that the publicity chairman be enabled to prepare a set of scrap books for fraternity circulation and other new publicity measures. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 35 That Pollard Cottage be renovated. That the writing of the name Arrowcraft be made to conform to that as registered in the patent office, i.e., one word. That a new film of the welfare phase of our work be done in color. That the Director plan for the furnishings of the Stuart Cottage and as soon as possible submit an estimate. That some adequate fire protection be installed immediately, according to plan and advice of the County Sanitary Director and subject to approval of the Committee and Grand Council. That some of the money given as gifts last year be used to purchase a movie projector if laws permit its use in the high school building. That the steps to the Health Center be rebuilt and the surgical dressing room be painted. That $100.00 be allowed to obtain a new bull in exchange for the old, and $150.00 allowed to purchase a new horse. That a second rest room of the Arrowcraft Shop be equipped. That the addition of a bag for the nurse and a small refrigerator for serums to the equipment of the Health Center be approved, deferring the purchase in the hope that they may be obtained as gifts. That a concrete walk be built across the pasture from Pollard Cottage to the Health Center. That new showers be built for the gymnasium if after further study it seems advisable. Signed, LOLITA S. PROUTY, Secretary. EPO T OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE e\.7THER year brings another report of the 1progress and expansion of our Settlement School. We Pi Phis who, by our sustained interest and support have made such development possible, have reason to grow more proud of our project. It has become in these twenty-eight years a philanthropy which is unique among both men's and women's fraternities. When delegates from the regional Panhellenic conference at Knoxville visited the school last fall, they voiced amazement at the scope of our undertaking, and whole-hearted approval. Many remarked on the enviable position it gave us in comparison to other organizations. Through its Chairman, the Settlement School committee makes an annual report of its steward-ship, giving to the Fraternity a present-day picture of the school, with its changes, expansion, and policies. As always, any discussion of the school falls into certain divisions, which are in general, the school elementary and high school health department, buildings, and Arrowcraft. This has been a year of changes, but the one of most concern to all of us came in March, when our well-loved Director, Mrs. Eunice Weaver, had to re-sign because of illness. Her leaving was regretted by committee, staff and townspeople alike, for all felt a deep affection for her. In her seven years as director, she had established herself firmly in the life of the school and community, through her fine sense of responsibility, her pleasant responsiveness to all, and her ability to cope with any difficulties which arose, We shall miss her more than can be expressed. The grade and high school have been well-staffed this year, with Mr. King, our able super-intendant as the head. Charlotte Herman, Illinois Z, in charge of the home-economics department, has built up and maintained interest in her program for the high school girls. She has also worked with the adult women. William Coe has again handled efficiently the vocational agriculture, con-ducting both adult and student classes. Cleo Nelson, North' Dakota Alpha, has been in charge of English classes and the library. Of these only Charlotte Herman will return next year, as Mr. King feels that he must give his undivided attention to the renting of his tourist cabins, and Cleo Nelson is taking a business position. We shall miss Mr. King tremendously, as in his eleven years with us we have learned to rely on his loyalty, good judgment, and efficiency. How-ever, we hope that, since he is to remain in Gatlinburg, we shall be able to count on his continued interest, and help in emergencies. Cleo Nelson has been well-liked and we regret to have to replace her, but we know our new Pi Phi from Kansas B, Miriam Moore, will prove as valuable. After two years as head of the new course in wood and metal crafts, William Oakes is being replaced, since we hope to make changes in the course which will demand a teacher of different capability and training. You all know, of course, that the elementary school is entirely supported by the county, but is under our supervision. After having the teachers recommended by us, the county board elects them, half to be Pi Phis and half to be county girls. The school will remain under the direction of C. Perm Price who continues his untiring efforts that the grade A rating given ,by the state last year may be retained. Our Pi Phi teachers this year all doing splendid work have been Ruth Parker, whom we were delighted to have return unexpectedly to us this year for her third year of service; Pauline Morris, New York A; Florabelle DeWitt, Colorado B; and Doris Hatch, Illinois A. Three county girls, Pauline Sharp, Veryl Elder, and Eleanor Brabson will return next year to continue their successful work. Our high school enrollment increased so greatly this year, that the freshman classes in some studies were too large to conform to the state requirements. Therefore, for this coming year we shall' be allowed an extra teacher. We have every reason to be proud of our school program in which minds and bodies have been successfully developed. We hope that handicraft can take an increasingly important place in the lives of boys and girls while they are at our school, and we are laying plans to bring this about, In my five years on the committee, I have heard repeated discussions of the necessity of adding courses in art and music. I think that this year may see our plans take definite form in putting these in the school curriculum. After visiting classes on my trips to the school, and seeing the vivid interest displayed by pupils in their studies, 3 6 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW I feel that if we give additional opportunities to these children, they will be eagerly seized. Besides this, if we are to market handicraft of these mountain people, we should give the children some training in color and line, so that as they grow older they may develop their sense of the beautiful and fitting, and produce increasingly fine work. To speak of the school brings up necessarily the health work which is done with the pupils. We have always tried to educate both adults and children along sanitary and health lines, and through inoculations and clinics we have brought up the standard of living in the community until we have practically eliminated such diseases as hookworm, typhoid, and even diphtheria. Marjorie Chalmers, R.N., as head of this department for the past five years, has been not only efficient, but sympathetic and understanding. The county is able to furnish little but serums, so in reality we supply a county nurse. Her days are always full, but when an epidemic of flu strikes the community, we wonder at the number of her calls each day. The question of sanitation in the village and outlying districts is an increasingly urgent one since tourists have flocked into the town, and at present there is always potential danger of an epidemic if there happens to be a long dry spell. Town waterworks are a necessity if this is to be avoided. The group of buildings on our hundred acres vary in age from the old one, housing arts and crafts, to the gracious new Arrowcraft shop, and as their age varies, their need of repairs, and maintenance varies. The older buildings require an increasingly greater amount in the budget for repairs and improvements, while of course, the newer ones demand less. The "budget" how brief the word looks, but what hours of study it exacts from the committee at their annual meeting! Donations are uncertain always, but needs remain constant or increase. This year our receipts from clubs and chapters will fall below what we counted upon, and we are thankful that magazine subscriptions have sold so well. Under Beatrice Purdunn's capable direction, the magazine agency shows an increased profit of $865 over last year. This year we are adding to our buildings, through the generosity of Anne Stuart, Nebraska )3, who left a bequest of $10,000, a new Stuart Cottage for use as a boys' dormitory. Barber and McMurray, the architects of our attractive new Arrowcraft shop, have drawn plans for a modern, two-story structure which can accommodate eight boys and two teachers, to replace the old frame dormitory. Two other Pi Phis have been generous, too, in naming the Settlement School as beneficiary in their wills: Mary Rosestengell Ross, Wisconsin A, from whose estate we will receive approximately $370, and Sue Graham Walsh, Colorado A, whose bequest will amount to about $320. The committee will decide at their meeting this June just how this money can best be used, since neither donor specified to what purpose it should be put, but we are indeed grateful for having the school re-membered. In charge of the buildings which house the sixteen dormitory students, and superintending them in their work about the place, is Miss Annette Morse, Illinois A. Her duties are various, but in spite of the demands on her time, she has managed to add to the furnishings and build up the supply of bedding by her thrifty mending and wise expenditure. Arrowcraft continues to be a successful business. So many Settlement School chairmen have reported how and why it has developed, that I shall not go into its past history. Two factors have contributed largely to its success. One of these is theunforeseen chance which opened one of the most popular of the national parks at our front door, and the other the wise selection as Director of Arrowcraft, Mrs. Ethel Weaver Snow, Iowa For the past seven years, by the sound business judgment, and able handling of her department, she has caused Arrowcraft to maintain a steady development. The volume of business has increased from year to year, due in part to the tourist trade, but also to a great extent because of our club sales. We have two shops in Gatlinburg, one under the supervision of Mrs. Snow, and the other in the Mountain View Hotel managed by Mrs. Georgia Duffield who, as has been said before, sells II B 1 with every article. "Miss Georgia" is noteworthy, also for her church and community interest. Our weaving supervisor, Winogene Redding, has contributed to the development of the business, through her wise buying of raw materials, appealing design of the woven articles, and tactful management of her ninety-five weavers. Nor ought to be overlooked the part which those efficient and attractive local girls, Edna and Bess McCarter, and Lura Oweneby, play in building up Arrowcraft. The first year in our new building shows the wisdom of our venture, for this year's sales have set a high level for all time. Beautifully designed, it attracts the eye of all tourists. A problem which has arisen this year and which holds serious potential difficulty for us, is the revision of the present Wage and Hour Act to include a code for workers weaving in their own homes. All members of the different weaving guilds will be affected by any increase in scale of pay, so, after an investigator of the Labor Department had visited the various shops, they decided to unite in furnishing correct information and statistics, in hope that such a radical increase might not he written into the law as to put them out of business. At the meeting of the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild, our Gene Redding was chosen to represent them in Washington, if need occurs, to appear at hearings there. Of course, there has been a great deal of correspondence on this matter, but all sent out by us has been submitted to the Fraternity's lawyers for their approval. No definite action has been taken as yet by the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor, and we hope that the matter can be adjusted satisfactorily without jeopardizing our Gatlinburg industry. In the emergency caused by the illness of Mrs. Weaver and her subsequent resignation, the whole staff carried on nobly. It was thought best by the committee to place temporarily in charge of the management of the school, the heads of the three departments: Mrs. Snow of Arrowcraft, Mrs. Chalmers of the health department, and Miss Annette Morse, our house manager and house mother. With Mrs. Snow as chairman, this group of three has had to deal with the problems which arose. In view of the critical situation, it was voted that I should make a special visit in April after Mrs. Weaver left, and give such advice and aid as I THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 37 could to help them organize the work. After spending a week there, I left with the comfortable assurance that everyone was doing her best to keep the school running as usual. Later in May we were fortunate enough to have the former Chair-man of the Settlement School Committee, Lillian Beck Holton, spend a week there as she returned from the Gamma Province Conference in South Carolina. Her calm judgment and excellent advice was never more valued than in this time of stress at the school. We of the Committee appreciated greatly her taking the time and trouble to make the visit. There have been changes in our staff other than in replacing the Director. Our competent and versatile bookkeeper, Frances Brown, Missouri r, resigned after three years of able service at the school. She is being replaced temporarily by Miss Alice Kiburtz, but we still have to find a II 13 cl, accountant who can fill the position. We have in the past few days voted to put in as Director of the School, Mrs. Elizabeth Comstock Peck, California B, whom we feel is well able to fill the position. Having not only been a business woman, but also a housekeeper and mother, she will doubtless be capable of dealing with the diverse problems which arise at the school. She arrives to take her new position early in June, and we feel sure that her pleasant personality and efficient training will make her a most capable Director. This year there are also changes on the Settlement School Committee, two of us rounding out our terms of five years. Jeffries Green Pace, who has furnished the interesting material for "News from Little Pigeon," is retiring this year, as am I. We both voice a great sadness at completing our term of office. However, the three members who are going on with the work make a most competent nucleus for the new board. Ethel Hogan Copp, California Gamma, who has been our secretary, will be the new chairman, and being five feet of dynamic energy, she will carry on the school management most successfully. Irene Eldridge, Wisconsin B, continues as treasurer, taking charge of all donations from Pi Phis, checking the work of the bookkeeper at the school, and in short, supervising all the financial affairs of the school. Beth Brainerd Le Roy, Massachusetts A, has been in charge of publicity and the routing of the films this year. We have kept in constant touch with each other by correspondence and sometimes telegraph, discussing the problems which have arisen since our annual meeting last July. As Chairman of the Committee, I made the usual winter visit to the school to see that the recommendations made by the committee were being carried out, and that the budget was being followed. At this time I, of course, had no idea that a second trip would be necessary. In being chairman of a standing committee, I have been delighted to see how efficiently the work of the Fraternity at large is being carried on. Although the contact member of the committee is the Grand President, I have found that all members of Grand Council have taken a great interest in the work of the school. In the beginning of this report, I spoke of the changes, expansion, and policies in the school. We have now come to consideration of these latter, present and future. Each year at the Committee meeting we pause to consider seriously how the school is developing, that we may make our actions in the right direction. Not only does the welfare of the community have to be considered, but also the wishes of all Pi Phis. When we are in Gatlinburg, listening to reports and informal discussions by staff and townspeople, it is a far simpler thing to know how they feel than to entertain your thoughts and desires about the school. Pi Phis bring back varying reports, according to the extent of their contacts during their stay. One of them may speed in over the highway, reach a hotel at nightfall, after dinner walk up the Neon-lighted main street to our Arrowcraft shop where she examines the stock with interest and asks some questions about the school and town, then leaves early the next morning. Another, however, comes for a stay of a day or two, in which time she makes a leisurely tour of the whole school plant, takes a hike or horseback trip over the mountain trails into the sparsely settled districts just outside of the Burg, and talks to everyone she meets. Each of these receives different impressions of the life and needs of the community, and their re-ports conflict. Some of these visitors have questioned the advisability of our continuing our work in the face of the growing sophistication of Gatlinburg, and to these I replied in the May ARROW. Because the needs reached by us have changed in character does not lessen their importance or number or our responsibility. The future of the school, like the future of many other things in our changing world, does not stretch clearly before us. The wisdom of curtailment or expansion, of shifts in curriculum, or of changes in policy, has to be reached after much discussion and investigation in committee meeting, and after all, may not prove to be wisdom. In the year intervening between meetings, trends may alter the whole school picture, as they reflect state and national changes. Decisions may be made which are impossible to carry out, or greatly delayed in putting into effect. For instance, it was agreed, in keeping with our desire to let these mountain people assume responsibility as their ability to do so increases, that the community would soon be able to house their elementary school instead of using our building and paying us rent as it has done heretofore. However, we find this will take time, as the process of transference is an involved one, necessitating adoption by the town of a resolution to erect a building, appearance before the legislature in their biannual meeting to get permission to float a bond issue, and ability to sell those bonds. So, in ending this 1941 report, I wish to ask as all chairmen before me have asked your continued support of our school, not only financially but in enthusiastic interest and sympathetic understanding. The tributes paid to our philanthropy by outsiders should give us fine assurance as to its lasting value as a memorial to our Founders. Respectfully submitted, MARIE B. HAGEE Be sure to send a contribution to the Holt House. 3 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHO )F Tl'':EASU REII' S ACCOUNTS YEA L REPO ENDE T ON AUDIT JUNE 30, 1941 August 29, 1941 9 the Settlement School Committee, Beta Phi Fraternity, ffice of Settlement School Treasurer, 'Lilwaukee, Wisconsin. EAR MESDAMES: We have examined the records maintained by e Treasurer of your Committee for the Pi !ta Phi Settlement School for the fiscal year Lded June 30, 1941. With the data drawn DM these records we have combined the report .epared by Homer K. Jones and Company, pub-: accountants, from the subsidiary records kept / the School and its Arrowcraft Shop at Gatlburg, Tennessee, and we submit herewith the suiting attached statements. In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet Ld related statements of income and surplus Arent fairly the financial position of the Pi Beta Settlement School at June 30, 1941, and the come and expenses for the fiscal year then ended, bject to the extent of our own verification, which indicated above did not include the Gatlinburg cords. We examined and tested the income from Club Ld Chapter contributions, which are shown in dell in Schedule 3-a, and from magazine agencies Ld we found adequate support and authorization / the expenditures made directly by the Treaser. The cash balances at Milwaukee were verid by us. The endowment securities and cash, :cept cash in transit, were certified to by the arris Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago, Trus-.s for the endowment funds, and this Trustee's port was accepted without further verification cept that we checked the accounting made of anges in .investments and the income from se-rides and found it in good order. COMMENTS rsh Balances The cash balances at June 30, 1941, exclusive of 5h with the Endowment Trustees or in transit, n.sisted of the following: ilwaukee Accounts: First Wisconsin National Bank Treasurer's checking account $17,772.62 First Wisconsin National Bank Treasurer's savings account 1,040.22 ttlinburg School Accounts: Sevier County Bank School check ing account 116.69 Sevier County Bank House checking account 138.09 Sevier County Bank Arts and Crafts account 52.30 alinburg Arrow Craft Accounts: Sevier County Bank Checking ac count 2,660.05 Bank of Sevierville Savings account 3,018.75 Hamilton National Bank Savings ac count 6,133.62 Morris Plan Bank Savings account. Petty cash funds at Gatlinburg Total $37,158.35 As indicated above, we verified the balances in Milwaukee accounts while those at Sevierville or Knoxville were verified by Homer K. Jones and Company, according to their report. Accounts Receivable The Arrowcraft accounts receivable at June 30, 1941 amounted to $6,548.23 and were due principally from alumnae clubs. These accounts, which we did not verify, were listed in the report of Homer K. Jones and Company, and were $2,712.14 less than those at the close of the previous year. Fixed Assets Expenditures for additions to buildings, equipment, and landscaping amounted to $1,980.27 for the year under review. These expenditures are classified in Schedule 2. Depreciation of the buildings and equipment, computed at rates used in the past, totaled $3,072.46 as shown in the same schedule. Included in the income for 1940-1941 is a bequest of $9,250.00 which we are informed by your Treasurer was designated for building purposes and we understand that a building is now under construction which will absorb this amount but no expenditures for this purpose had been recorded prior to the close of the year. Endowment The only changes in the endowment principal for the year under review consisted of the three-fourths appropriation from chapter contributions of $1,404.75 offset to a considerable extent by losses on securities of $876.96, the fund showing a net increase of $527.79. The security losses were due to writing off a worthless bond of $1,000.00, the securities which were redeemed or sold actually yielding a profit of $123.04. No amortization of bond premiums is charged 'against income by the Trustee although the securities on hand cost $1,788.64 more than par value. These securities are listed in Schedule 1. Current Income and Expenses The income of the Settlement School exceeded operating expenses by $7,017.34 while the Arrow-craft net profit totaled $14,103.08. The Settlement School income, however, included the bequest of $9,250.00 for building purposes as pointed out above. On the other hand the expenses included depreciation of $3,072.46, a large part of which is attributable to operation of the Arrowcraft shops and stores. The Arrowcraft net income was approximately $3,300.00 greater than that of the previous year, the sales totaling $54,545.35 as compared to $42,951.03 for 1939-1940. The percentage of gross profit on sales was not quite as favorable for the current year as it was for 1939-1940.

The driveway has been changed to the side of the house with parking space toward the rear. This gives a solid expanse of lawn in front. Native shrubs surround it. One of the Park men helped us with the landscaping. The little rustic bridge at the side has been moved up the creek a few feet so that the school children do not cross the corner there. With a few more additions on the interior it should be complete. Hardly a customer fails to exclaim over its beauty. Taking it month by month through the year business has been consistently better. The amount of returns remained about the same but they were sent back earlier in the year as a whole. One particular club so far out-distanced all the rest this year they should be mentioned in this report. Berkeley up to June 1 has sold $1,911.80 with the month of June to bring it up to two thousand. The next highest sales record was the New York Club with $970.94. Dallas was a close third. To spoil that picture there is over $5,800 out-standing on our books against clubs. This represents unsold goods or failure to send in money promptly. I am still in hopes the month of June will clear up a great deal of that as our books go SCHOOL URING these last weeks of school Mrs. Weaver has been sorely missed. Perhaps I can give you a brief outline of some of the things that have happened. The grade school was out the latter part of April and the following teachers have been elected for next school year. Mr. Pern Price of. Gatlinburg will remain as Principal. Pauline Sharp, Eleanor Brabson, and Veryl Elder will return from the County. Doris Hatch, Illinois A and Flora Belle De Witt, Colorado B, will also return to us in the Fall. Due to the marriage of Ruth Parker and the resignation of Pauline Morris there will be two new Pi Phis to take their places, Mary Hayward, Arizona A, and Sue Viering, Illinois A. Mr. King, who has been Superintendent for ten years, tendered his resignation. Mr. Fleming will take his place. Cleo Nelson, North Dakota A, has also resigned. Miriam Moore, Kansas B, will be to an auditor the first day of July. The Fall Guild meeting was just over the mountain at the Cherokee Indian Reservation in North Carolina. The spring meeting was in Knoxville as usual, followed by a meeting of Southern Highlanders Inc. at Norris in the afternoon. The Southeastern Arts Association was meeting in Knoxville at the same time. A great number of our things were in their display. Besides attending those three meetings I have visited the John C. Campbell Folk School this past year. The Guild Shop in Asheville has done so well through the years that it was decided to use part of the small surplus to start another shop in the Shenandoah National Park. Arrowcraft, as a member, will have that as another market. We have already had several re-orders but it is too early to know if they will be able to sell as much as Allan-stand has for us. In making out a recent report I find that one third is sold as cash sales to the passing tourists, one sixth wholesale to other shops through the country, and one half by our own alumnae clubs and active chapters. That is a grand record to have kept through the years. Respectfully submitted, ETHEL WEAVER SNOW the Pi Phi to take her place. The new County teacher on the High School staff is to be Margaret Burchfield of Sevierville. -She is graduating with high honors from the University of Tennessee and will go on to summer school to finish her Library training so that she may have charge of the School Library along with her other work. The County board allowed us enough money for one other high school teacher this coming year. It has to be some one who can teach chemistry and I am still hoping some outstanding Pi Phi will offer her services. There is also a position open to a Pi Phi who knows double entry bookkeeping. Mrs. Elizabeth Peck, California B, comes to us very soon as the new Director. The rest of the school staff remains the same. Their reports will speak for themselves. Respectfully submitted, ETHEL WEAVER SNOW \ i \ T EPO Convention, June 21-27, 1942, New Ocean House, Swampscott, Mass. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW WEAVING DEPA ow that the Arrowcraft fiscal year for 1941 is about to pass into history, we can say hat we have produced more weaving during this han in any previous year. We have had a total of 7 women weaving for us which is not our highest ecord but they have earned more during the year han any other group. This year in the eleven aonths ending May 1941 they have earned 12,636.35. In the same period a year ago they tad earned $10,114.27 or a gain of $2,522.08. In )ecember 1940 we reached an all-time high for ,ne month when we paid the weavers $3,196.68. 'he weavers have shown their same loyalty and ooperation throughout the year that they always D. The play "Store Britches," the most ambitious indertaking the Weaver's Guild has ever atempted, was a decided success. The two casts gave 7 performances during the summer tourist season. 'he play was enthusiastically received by those vho saw it. The proceeds of the final performance vere given to the Gatlinburg Public Library and hey also gave $25.00 to the. Red Cross. Five veavers have borrowed from the fund to get ;lasses, one to pipe water into her house, and one a pay for an x-ray of her husband's stomach. They are planning to give the play again as a wrist attraction during July and August with the lea in mind of making it an annual affair whose hief value would be to keep alive in an authentic lay a bit of the fast-disappearing type of mountain amily life. This year the play will be under the omplete direction of Mrs. Phillip Maxwell. The greatest and most serious development as ar as our weaving is concerned during the year 3 the effect that the application of the Fair Labor tandards Act may have. The Southern Highland landicraft Guild has been carrying on negotiaions with the U. S. Department of Labor since 1st March. As this will affect not only Arrowcraft ut all handicraft organizations of the country qually, the Directors of the Guild thought that here is strength in unity and that we would get urther with the negotiations to have the Guild aembers represented as a whole rather than inividually. It is on. this basis that Arrowcraft has been ,articipating. All reports and correspondence that ve sent to Washington have been submitted to 4iss Onken or Mrs. Hagee first for approval. At the request of the Guild last March, as they were anticipating the investigation from Washagton anyway, the Hearings /Branch of the U. S. )epartment of Labor sent one of their staff memers to the annual meeting of the Guild in Knox-file. She stayed in the region three weeks making TMENT 1940-41 an extensive study of the work and set-up of the important centers in which Guild members were located. She stayed four days in Gatlinburg and visited not only Arrowcraft but the other shops as well, as they would have to comply with the law if they are in Interstate Commerce. This would automatically eliminate the price competition with which we have always been faced locally. Because hand-loom weaving would be the most difficult handicraft to readjust, a committee representing the important weaving members of the Guild was appointed with myself as chairman, to make an exhaustive study of weaving that is done in the homes and paid by the piece. This study included not only the producing but the marketing of weaving. The committee met in Gatlinburg on April 18 with seven weaving centers represented. The report of their findings has not yet been sent to the Department of Labor as they are still working on some of the questions that were sent to them by the Department of Labor to be studied. At the present time nothing definite has been decided and the issue is still in the hands of the President of the Guild and the Department of Labor. The future selling prices of weaving are hard to predict with the uncertainty that is attached both to the advancing of the prices for materials and the probable application to handicrafts of the Wage and Hour Act. I have tried to safeguard as much as possible against the continuous advance in the price of materials by buying in quantity supplies of wool and linen before the rise took place. This is only a temporary advantage for as long as the war lasts, prices will continue to change. Wool has gone up recently and linen has already advanced over 100% with the supply uncertain. We have on hand enough staple linen to last us 8 to 12 more months and wool to last 6 to 8 months at our present rate of production with but few additional purchases. Cotton prices have not advanced materially as yet. This will necessarily mean increasing our selling prices on many of the woven articles and the cautious weaving of all our linens. It would help our weaving program tremendously this fall if the Clubs would not over-estimate the linens they will need for their sales and order on the hand-to-mouth plan. Everything that we do not have to weave will conserve our supply of materials that cannot be replaced at the prices we paid for them. I hesitate to overstock in face of the uncertain times ahead. Respectfully submitted, WINOGENE B. REDDING PRINCIPAL'S ANNUAL EPO T, 1940.41 1st' THE 1940-41 school year opened on Tuesday after Labor Day, with the brightest promise of very successful school year. The opening day's nrollment was the largest on record for the high chool, and both pupils and teachers seemed nxious to get down to work. The teaching staff was composed of: William wing, principal, History and Social Science; Ben qeming, Mathematics, Science, and Coach; Cleo Nelson, English and Librarian; William Coe, Vocational Agriculture; Charlotte Herman, Vocational Home Economics; and William Oakes, Vocational Handicrafts. Miss Nelson and Miss Herman, the new members of the staff, while lacking in experience, worked hard at the job and the high school ran along as smoothly as could be expected. The large enrollment made a longer school day THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 49 necessary as more classes had to be taught by the same teaching force. The school day was lengthened from six to eight periods, and the length of the periods changed from sixty to forty-five minutes. A new course in Biology was introduced for the sophomore class and Sociology was added for the seniors. The course of study this year consisted of: English, four units; Science, three units; History, and Social Science, four units; Mathematics, three units; Vocational Agriculture, three units; Vocational Home Economics, three units, and Handicrafts, one unit; a total of twenty-one classes daily. The high school enrollment showed a consider-able increase of the preceding year. This rate of increase will probably continue for two more years and then will level off, unless school busses are added to bring students from other communities.

They won thirteen games and lost JENNIE N][COL MEMO TWENTY years ago, the Jennie Nicol Memorial Health Center moved into the little white cottage that had been the home of the Andrew Ogle family. Through the years of service and friendly understanding, the few cases of the beginning years have grown to hundreds. Methods change as need arises, but the pioneers builded well, and the policies have changed but little. One of the most important phases of the work of the Health Center, is the care of the maternity cases. Twenty-six mothers were on the records for the year, most of whom were under the super-vision of some doctor. Advice on diet and exercise, lists and articles for layettes, preparation for home delivery or for hospitalization were given. Regular check of weight and general condition were kept as often as possible. Some of the new babies had regular nursing care for a few days, and some as well as older babies had formulas or diets regulated as necessary. Many of them have been in for the Friday after-noon clinics many times. One premature baby was fed with a medicine dropper for several days, until she was strong enough to nurse, and kept in a warmed basket in lieu of an incubator. One baby developed pneumonia, with supplementary infection, and lived but twenty-four hours, in spite of every treatment that could be suggested by the specialists in Knoxville. An oxygen tank was even borrowed from a service station and an inhalation mask devised from a paper sack, all to no avail. Henry, aged two and a half, and nearly blind from an attack of meningitis the year previous, one during the regular playing season, and went to the semi-finals in the district tournament. Four-teen players were awarded letters at the close of the season. The Settlement School staff put on the play "Who's Crazy Now" to a large and appreciative audience. The purpose of the play was to raise money for a moving picture machine for the school. The junior class presented a play in the fall and the senior class gave two plays to raise money for their trip to Washington. The trip of the senior class to the nation's capital, was one of the high lights of the school year for the seniors. They worked all year to make the necessary money for transportation. They had a five day trip, going to Washington by way of Natural Bridge and the Skyline Drive. They spent two days sightseeing in Washington and returned home by way of Yorktown, Norfolk, and Virginia Beach. The various clubs of the school had a very active year. The Home Economics club and the FFA furnished much of the social life of the school. The glee club under the direction of Mrs. Chalmers and Miss Nelson furnished the music for commencement. Dr. Stewart W. McClelland, President of , Lincoln Memorial University, delivered the commencement address, and Rev. W. D. Wilkinson preached the Baccalaureate sermon. Twenty seniors received their diplomas. Respectfully submitted, WILLIAM KING, Principal IAL HEALTH CENTE had an eye examination by Dr. Robert Leech of Knoxville. The child seems to do little more than distinguish light from darkness, and there seems little hope of any improvement. Probably at some later date, he may be placed in some school for some sort of training. Little red-headed Marjorie, whose left foot was straightened by Dr. Bagwell, is walking freely. Six months old Margaret has both tiny legs in casts for club foot correction. She is a patient of the Crippled Children's Clinic, and reports there on alternate Fridays for observation, change of cast or treatment. The Crippled Children's work is done under the auspices of the Sevier County Post of the American Legion, and by state funds. School inspections were held at intervals during the year at Gatlinburg, and at the six rural schools. Inoculations for typhoid, diphtheria, and small pox were made as necessary in each place. Talks pertaining to health were ,made in class rooms and in other meetings. The general health of the school children seems to be improving year by year. Fewer are underweight, due to supervised lunches, and increased knowledge of both parents and children. The Sevierville Lions Club has bought glasses for several children of the district, and r sorority aids in the correction of defects. A number of children had tonsils removed, a few had appendectomies, and many visited the dentist. There were innumerable dressings, a few fractures, and many sprains. But the high light of the school health program is the lessening of the old enemy, impetigo. Better living conditions, more balanced 10 \ 50 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW diet, and persistence of treatment, are undoubtedly responsible. Community nursing consists mostly of emergency or special treatment. Post-operative dressings, massage, hypodermics, irrigations, and instruction in home nursing. Several were taken to Cancer or Tuberculosis Clinics, and for X-rays. Three doctors in Sevierville have infirmaries, and rapid ambulance service has made it possible to transport patients quickly and safely. The Loan Closet continues to be of great service. Crutches, rubber sheeting, bed pans, hot water bottles, and ice caps are borrowed in case of need, and returned for the use of others. Night clothing for children and adults, and baby things are used again and again. As always, we are grateful for the cooperation met on every side, from the doctors who so freely give advice and aid, the members of the staff, and of the Fraternity. Above all, we are grateful for the friendship and appreciation of the people of the community. The work of the Health Center seems to go beyond mere physical needs. Worry and unhappiness are as tangible as disease, and a tonic for the ELEMENTA THE Ij[ B (1, Elementary School opened on September 3, 1940 with the following teachers: Eleanor Brabson, primer; Doris Hatch, first grade; Ruth Parker, second grade; Veryle Elder, third grade; Pauline Morris, fourth grade; Pauline Sharp, fifth grade; Flora Belle DeWitt, sixth and seventh grades ; C. Pern Price, eighth grade. For the seventh consecutive year the II B Elementary School has won the cup in the Blue Ribbon contest for the larger schools. This is quite a distinction as no other school in the county, large or small, can equal this record. For the second year the elementary school has been given a rating of 100% in the sanitation program. We are one of the twelve schools in the county to make this record. A number of books for our library were given to us by friends from Muncie, Indiana. Most all system no more necessary than a tonic for morale. It is our sincere hope that the Health Center may continue to stand for those things, whatever they may be, that will make life happier and more healthful for our people.

MARJORIE CHALMERS, R.N. Y SCHOOL the books were fiction. On April 8, 1941, the faculty of the high school and elementary school gave a play, "Who's Crazy Now." In addition to the faculty Mrs. Snow and Miss Redding took part. The purpose of this play was to take the proceeds and apply on a 16 mm. motion picture machine for use of the school. The enrollment for 1940-41 was 285. The average daily attendance was 225. Inattendance, "flu" and other reasons kept this lower than it should have been. The elementary school had its first football team. Out of five games played they did not lose a game and had their goal line crossed only twice during the season. The largest eighth grade class to finish school in the elementary department finished this year. C. PERN PRICE HANDICRAFTS FoR my report I am giving you an exact list of the articles that were made by the high school group for the past year. There were fourteen in this group that finished this year. Five were seniors and nine juniors. There were five of this group who took other classes during this class period. Some few of them came in the afternoons to make some of this time up. I never had the entire group in the shop at the same time. I could not give the organized work that I should have given, because of this. There were some few that be-came quite skilled. If they could go on with this work, they could accomplish something. As it is they can't take another year because they have had two vocational credits and can have only four to graduate. This course gives two. All of the equipment is in first class order. There have been only a few tools lost. A handsaw, hammer, and a pair of side cutting pliers disappeared while the plumbers were here. Every member of the group this year made an article for the school, to be left here. Many thanks for the job and the many favors, Sincerely, WILLIAM O. OAKES HOME ECONOMICS DEPARTMENT ORTY-SEVEN girls were enrolled in Home five were freshmen, ten were sophomores, and FEconomks the largest number in the history twelve were juniors. The seniors were unable to of the Settlement School. Of this group, twentytake Home Economics as an elective because it THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 51 conflicted with their required courses. In the freshman class, the most popular units were those in clothing construction. The girls made simple blouses, skirts, and aprons in the fall to learn how to use the sewing machine and how to follow a commercial pattern. Some of the girls had sewed considerably at home so each girl chose a clothing problem according to her own skill level so that she could learn something new in her class project. At the end of the six weeks' unit in sewing, the class judged the dresses, and on this basis, two achievement awards were made. The awards were pins given by a commercial pattern company. The girls were very proud of their prizes. During the first semester, we also studied personal grooming, etiquette, and breakfast preparation and service. In October, the freshmen gave an afternoon tea for their mothers and the school staff. This was the climax of their study of manners, introductions, and the art of being a hostess. During the foods units the girls were divided into families for the purpose of working together in planning and preparing the food. Each family served a breakfast in early December, inviting one of the elementary school teachers as guest. In the second semester the freshmen studied child care and development, using their own brothers and sisters at home for observation; preparation and serving of luncheons; school lunches; and food for outdoor hikes and picnics. The sophomore class seemed to be most interested in the foods units. In our first unit food preservation, we canned tomatoes, and apple sauce, and made orange marmalade and apple jelly. As a result of this study, two of the girls made jelly for home projects. Awards similar to those the freshmen received were given the sophomores on the completion of their fall wool dresses. The weaving for the sophomores worked out very well this year because there was an even number of girls in the class so that each pair could work on one loom. Three of our six weeks were spent in making the warps and in setting up the looms for weaving. Each girl then wove a sampler, a towel, and a pillow top. While half the girls were weaving, the others were sewing on baby garments for the American Red Cross. Other units that the sophomores studied included: elements of nutrition, personal grooming, and luncheon preparation and service. 0 MITO THE year of 1940-41 has been a very busy one. As in any household, looking back, it is hard to say what has been accomplished. The culinary department has been taken care of by Belle Lowe and Mrs. Lurie Hurst, and the necessary upkeep such as mending, new curtains, helping the boys and girls, has fallen to me. Two of our girls left us in April to ride the bus to school, but I replaced them by another. The juniors were especially interested in individual development, so our year's work was planned along that line. The first semester they studied personality improvement, personal grooming, clothing budgets and wardrobes, and clothing construction. Two of the girls made wool suits, several made afternoon dresses, and the others made wool school dresses. One week was spent in the, study of vocations for girls. Nursing, office work, and elementary school teaching were especially interesting to the class. The second semester the juniors took up special party cookery, food and health, textiles, clothing construction, and outdoor cookery. At Christmas time, the sophomores planned the menu, decorated, and served the annual dinner for the faculty. The juniors were in charge of food preparation. This spring the juniors planned and prepared the food for the F.F.A. boys and their parents, and the freshmen and sophomores decorated and served. Ninety guests were served in the general science laboratory. Four girls went to the Open House at the University of Tennessee. One junior modelled a two-piece wool dress and a sophomore modelled a spring skirt and jerkin. In March, the juniors took a field trip to Knoxville to visit the furniture stores, after studying about the different types of furnishings suitable for their own homes. Each girl completed three home projects, in addition to her class work. Sewing seemed to be the most popular type of project. Among the projects were: quilts, baby and children's clothes, curtains, pillow cases, slip covers for chairs, and all types of clothes for the girls themselves. Some of the food projects were: baking; preparation of breakfasts, luncheons, and suppers; and a study of pastries. The Home Economics Club had fifty-five members this year. Bi-weekly meetings were held, with programs planned by the girls at each meeting. From November through March, the Home Economics teacher and the Agriculture teacher con-ducted a joint class for adult men and women at the Laurel Grove School in Wear's Valley. The classes met an hour and a half every two weeks. Among the topics discussed for women were: home gardens, menu planning, food and health, and canning. Respectfully submitted, CHARLOTTE HERMAN MS, 1940-41 I have bought five unfinished dressers for th, girls' dormitory and finished them, and had tit floor in the dining room sanded and waxed, an( with Mrs. Hagee's assistance bought a linoleun rug for "Miss Georgic's" room. I would recommend that the kitchen be painted and if it is possible that an electric mixer b purchased for the kitchen. Respectfully submitted, ANNETTE MORSE 5 2 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE ALL DAY CLASSES: This year's enrollment in this group reached a total of fifty-one boys. Three classes were taught in Vocational Agriculture. These classes consisted of twenty-five freshman boys, another class was made up of seventeen sophomores and still another consisted of eight iunior and senior boys. This year we had thirty-four of the fifty-one beginning boys to complete the entire school year. The remaining thirty-foul boys are at present conducting complete supervised Farming Programs. EVENING SCHOOL CLASSES: One night school was conducted in the Laurel Grove Community for those men who are established in the business of farming. This adult class I teach at least one night out of each month and this continues throughout the year. This year we had seventeen meetings with a total of fifty-three farmers enrolled. Our course of study is based on the needs of the community. We made surveys to determine what were the farming and living conditions of the Laurel Grove Community. After spending one class meeting in a discussion of our data, the farmers came to the conclusion that their greatest problem was low income. Farmers were then led to set up objectives which would increase their farm income. They were: 1. To increase soil fertility through (a) liming (b) phosphating (c) rotating crops (d) growing winter cover crops 2. To provide livestock of good type to consume all feed produced on the farm. 3. To produce the home food supply on the farm as nearly as possible. 4. To improve the farm home and its surroundings through (a) providing electric lights and running water in the home. (b) repairing the farm home. (c) improving the home grounds. PART-TIME CLASSES: This year one class was taught to a group of out-of-school boys at Camp Morgan, the CCC camp which is located five miles away from the school. I met with this group of thirty-two boys one night each week to study problems pertaining to farming. These boys as a group have three projects on the camp grounds: 1. Poultry 2. Bees 3. Rabbits On January 1 of this year, there came aid through the Sevier County Board of Education to provide National Defense Training for out-ofschool rural and urban youth. The supervision of these .classes became the job of the Vocational Agriculture Teachers throughout the State. Our School provided two of these classes to this group. One of these was taught by Mr. Walter Cardwell in woodworking, in which twenty-five boys were enrolled. The other class is now being taught at Pigeon Forge Elementary School House by Mr. Fred Cooper. This course is in elementary electricity, in which twenty students are enrolled. It is hoped that these boys will be better able to do the necessary jobs in preparation for war or in time of war. We have an improved Farm Shop as a result of this training. We now have $264.00 worth of additional equipment for our farm shop. We think this equipment will become the property of Sevier County Board of Education and this will be left with the Agricultural Department of our School. THE FFA CHAPTER: The Future Farmers of America chapter has completed a most successful year. We have taken part in the following outside activities of the School: 1. Showing Dairy Cattle at the County Fair. 2. Exhibiting Farm products, farmshop work, and poultry at the County Fair and at the Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial Fair at Knoxville. 3. Sponsored FFA and Home Economics socials. 4. Livestock and Dairy cattle judging contest at the University of Tennessee in which sixty-eight high school chapters of FFA competed. (Pi Phi won third place in Livestock and Roy McCarter, a senior FFA boy, was high point contestant of the whole contest in which 209 boys entered.) 5. Sponsored Third Annual Parent and Son Banquet. (FFA boys invited their mothers and fathers. Eighty-seven parents and guests attended.) 6. Public Speaking contest at University. (Roy Ogle, a senior FFA boy, placed second in the 5th district which had 14 chapters competing.) 7. FFA Baseball and Basketball teams. 8. Presentation of the FFA cup to best All-around high school girl. 9. Two boys continue to produce Hybrid corn for seed. Last year one boy sold $224.00 worth of seed corn harvested from one acre. 10. Four town boys who are taking agriculture have rented land from the airport and have what appears to be successful Home Gar-dens. Some of these boys have in addition, Home Improvement, and twenty-five to fifty chicks for broilers. 11. CAMP CLEMENTS Five boys and I at-tended the Tennessee FFA camp for one week last summer. (Pi Phi won the athletic award for that week's activities.) 12. FFA field day, the last Saturday in April, found us competing in field meets at Powell Station High School, Knox County, with FFA chapters of the 5th district. The boys did well in the events, but their total points were not enough to surpass the Powell Station FFA. 13. RADIO PROGRAMS. This year the Pi Beta Phi FFA sponsored two programs over WNOX. The first program was presented by four boys who were growing Hybrid corn for seed. The Title of the program was GROWING HYBRID CORN. Our second program was entitled THE AGRICULTURAL CONDITION OF SEVIER . COUNTY AND HOW THE VOCATION-AL AGRICULTURE AT PI BETA PHI PLAYS ITS PART. This program was given by four senior FFA boys. 14. Tennessee FFA Convention was attended THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 53 by five boys and myself in Memphis, Tennessee, April 25 and 26. Our chapter was presented with the camp award, mentioned as a third place winner of the Livestock Judging contest and also that Roy McCarter from II B (1) had made the highest number of points of any boy in the East Tennessee Livestock judging contest. Dot Fox, a junior, and also a Hybrid Corn Grower, was awarded the degree of the Tennessee State planter. Dot plans to try to become an American farmer within the next two years. The fifth district of FFA offered three money awards to the best supervised farming program conducted by a boy last year. Dot won the second prize and the first prize went to a University of Tennessee Freshman boy of the college of agriculture. THE SCHOOL FARM: This year we had eight boys in the Dormitory who did the work on the farm and janitor work in the school houses. Six of these boys took Vocational Agriculture. They were given charge of certain enterprises in which they were responsible in their work. This causes the boy to take more interest in his work and thus a better job is done. Last fall our Jerseys, poultry, hogs, and farm products placed well at our County Fair. We had the Grand Champion animal of the Jersey Show. This year we have 140 white Leghorn hens in our laying flock. 100 white Leghorn sexed baby chicks were bought for replacements in the laying flock next fall. 800 baby chicks were bought and fed to broiler weight for Dining hall and to sell to the hotel. Mountain View Hotel uses all of our extra broilers which we produce and gives us a good price for them. Two modern brooder houses were constructed on the farm by agriculture boys as a part of their training in Agriculture. A water line was laid from the Boys' Dormitory to the incubator house. This makes it possible for us to provide ample water for livestock at the barn without having to carry it. As to the financial standing of the farm I pre-sent the following: Month Sold to Farm Farm Kitchen Expense Receipts July $ 229.09 $ 6.95 $ 37.93 August 194.36 412.23 4.00 September 145.69 80.71 2.00 October 205.49 152.68 23.35 November 145.25 273.76 36.16 December 141.01 254.62 19.00 January 157.52 3.88 64.48 February 150.05 273.92 72.10 March 264.51 90.22 April 236.69 155.81 27.63 May 175.20 336.78 247.62 Total $2,044.86 $2,052.45 $534.27 Sold to kitchen plus cash income $2,579.13 Total income less expenses 526.68 ).

        THE SEPTEMBER ARROW By supplying an ever-widening field in vocai.onal guidance, based upon an awakening to ,eauty of form and color, a whole community can ;radually make for itself a national center for de-.elopment of arts and crafts. Before interpreting too fully in terms of commitee deductions, we want you to know of a plan hat has been under way for years to compile factual roof of the humanitarian and educational value of hese tangible and intangible trends. Your committees have made every possible tudy preliminary to a factual survey from outide, unbiased, non Pi Phi authorities. You will understand our wish to have verificaion of or proof against certain trends; a desire or professional and experienced advice as to the .pplication of Pi Phi welfare service, not only in terms of need but in terms of whether the need justifies Pi Phi aid. You will welcome with us the authoritative and comprehensive survey regarding the soundness of the claim of a persistently challenging opportunity to expand our influence and create a new and satisfying future for the people of the Appalachian Mountains. Look for word of this in the December ARROW. Your committee welcomes and invites your suggestions, your opinions and your heartfelt wishes. Mutual enjoyment in sharing a great responsibility has given us a past of which we are proud. Mutual agreement and determination will build for us a happy future of greater service. ETHEL H. Cop?, Chairman Settlement School Committee. 'HUME OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE MEETING, 1941 THE MEMBERS of the II B 1 Settlement School Committee met for the annual meeting at the ,ettlement School from June 20 to June 28, 1941, vith three sessions a day. After an official welcome, specially of the new members, Agnes Spring and .olita Prouty, by Ethel Copp, the assignment of uties followed: Chairman, Ethel Copp. Treasurer, Irene Eldridge. Secretary Ways and Means, Lolita Prouty. Films and Publicity, Beth Le Roy. News from Little Pigeon, Agnes Spring. The Manual and the minutes of the 1940 meetig were read, followed by reports and recomiendations of committee and staff members. All !commendations were discussed and considered. Besides administrative problems, the Committee ttempted a survey of the community as to what :ley think of our project, and also a survey of the eeds of the community in regard to our future olicy. Marie Hagee, chairman for the past year, ras able to be present ex-officio at the request of to Committee with her invaluable assistance for lost of the sessions. Amy B. Onken, the Contactrith-Grand-Council-Member of the Committee for to year 1940-41, added her wealth of experience ad information for four days, during two of rhich all of Grand Council met with the Cornlittee. Among matters discussed with Grand Council ere: 1. A tentative physical plan of our development including discussions of: a. The giving over of the elementary school to the county. b. The new Stuart Cottage. c. A new Health Center. d. A new water system. e. A new gymnasium. 2. A discussion of the Wages and Hours Act. Miss Winogene Redding, weaving super-visor, reported on this and how it may affect our Arrowcraft industry if hand-loom weaving is not given exemption. 3. A consideration of the recommendations made by the Committee. The Committee felt it a special privilege to have le opportunity of personal discussion with Grand Council and hopes that it may serve the Fraternity more efficiently in the solution of the future trend of our project because of the exchange and comparison of ideas. Both the Committee and Grand Council felt we should know whether we are doing the right thing at the Settlement School and if not, what we should be doing, so definite plans were made for obtaining professional advice for the continued survey of needs and future trends of the Settlement School project. It was agreed to relinquish the first six years of the Elementary School to the County at the end of the school year 1942-43. In the discussion of this motion it was brought out that the County is able now to take over the School and at the present time has been paying us $125.00 a month for rent of the building and all the salaries of the elementary teachers. Since our building and equipment is becoming obsolete it would be necessary to build a new building if we kept the school much longer. The contracts were let for the construction, heating, wiring, and plumbing of the new Stuart Building at a cost of $8,600.00. A new Crafts teacher was hired, and special emphasis is to be put on that phase of work next year. An effort was made to secure a music teacher through the University of Tennessee and the W.P.A. music director by supplementing the salary of someone recommended by them. Among motions passed dealing with other matters were: That the discount allowed to alumni clubs on Arrowcraft orders be increased from 15 per cent to 20 per cent. That a safe reserve of Arrowcraft funds be maintained for Arrowcraft use. That the entire cost of the new boys' dormitory including the architect's fees be kept within the bequest of Anne Stuart, i.e., $9,200.00. That Bigridge and McCookville schools be turned back to the County for health supervision if after a conference with County officials, the Chairman thinks is advisable. That the budget for publicity be increased in order that the publicity chairman be enabled to prepare a set of scrap books for fraternity circulation and other new publicity measures. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 35 That Pollard Cottage be renovated. That the writing of the name Arrowcraft be made to conform to that as registered in the patent office, i.e., one word. That a new film of the welfare phase of our work be done in color. That the Director plan for the furnishings of the Stuart Cottage and as soon as possible submit an estimate. That some adequate fire protection be installed immediately, according to plan and advice of the County Sanitary Director and subject to approval of the Committee and Grand Council. That some of the money given as gifts last year be used to purchase a movie projector if laws permit its use in the high school building. That the steps to the Health Center be rebuilt and the surgical dressing room be painted. That $100.00 be allowed to obtain a new bull in exchange for the old, and $150.00 allowed to purchase a new horse. That a second rest room of the Arrowcraft Shop be equipped. That the addition of a bag for the nurse and a small refrigerator for serums to the equipment of the Health Center be approved, deferring the purchase in the hope that they may be obtained as gifts. That a concrete walk be built across the pasture from Pollard Cottage to the Health Center. That new showers be built for the gymnasium if after further study it seems advisable. Signed, LOLITA S. PROUTY, Secretary. EPO T OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE e\.7THER year brings another report of the 1progress and expansion of our Settlement School. We Pi Phis who, by our sustained interest and support have made such development possible, have reason to grow more proud of our project. It has become in these twenty-eight years a philanthropy which is unique among both men's and women's fraternities. When delegates from the regional Panhellenic conference at Knoxville visited the school last fall, they voiced amazement at the scope of our undertaking, and whole-hearted approval. Many remarked on the enviable position it gave us in comparison to other organizations. Through its Chairman, the Settlement School committee makes an annual report of its steward-ship, giving to the Fraternity a present-day picture of the school, with its changes, expansion, and policies. As always, any discussion of the school falls into certain divisions, which are in general, the school elementary and high school health department, buildings, and Arrowcraft. This has been a year of changes, but the one of most concern to all of us came in March, when our well-loved Director, Mrs. Eunice Weaver, had to re-sign because of illness. Her leaving was regretted by committee, staff and townspeople alike, for all felt a deep affection for her. In her seven years as director, she had established herself firmly in the life of the school and community, through her fine sense of responsibility, her pleasant responsiveness to all, and her ability to cope with any difficulties which arose, We shall miss her more than can be expressed. The grade and high school have been well-staffed this year, with Mr. King, our able super-intendant as the head. Charlotte Herman, Illinois Z, in charge of the home-economics department, has built up and maintained interest in her program for the high school girls. She has also worked with the adult women. William Coe has again handled efficiently the vocational agriculture, con-ducting both adult and student classes. Cleo Nelson, North' Dakota Alpha, has been in charge of English classes and the library. Of these only Charlotte Herman will return next year, as Mr. King feels that he must give his undivided attention to the renting of his tourist cabins, and Cleo Nelson is taking a business position. We shall miss Mr. King tremendously, as in his eleven years with us we have learned to rely on his loyalty, good judgment, and efficiency. How-ever, we hope that, since he is to remain in Gatlinburg, we shall be able to count on his continued interest, and help in emergencies. Cleo Nelson has been well-liked and we regret to have to replace her, but we know our new Pi Phi from Kansas B, Miriam Moore, will prove as valuable. After two years as head of the new course in wood and metal crafts, William Oakes is being replaced, since we hope to make changes in the course which will demand a teacher of different capability and training. You all know, of course, that the elementary school is entirely supported by the county, but is under our supervision. After having the teachers recommended by us, the county board elects them, half to be Pi Phis and half to be county girls. The school will remain under the direction of C. Perm Price who continues his untiring efforts that the grade A rating given ,by the state last year may be retained. Our Pi Phi teachers this year all doing splendid work have been Ruth Parker, whom we were delighted to have return unexpectedly to us this year for her third year of service; Pauline Morris, New York A; Florabelle DeWitt, Colorado B; and Doris Hatch, Illinois A. Three county girls, Pauline Sharp, Veryl Elder, and Eleanor Brabson will return next year to continue their successful work. Our high school enrollment increased so greatly this year, that the freshman classes in some studies were too large to conform to the state requirements. Therefore, for this coming year we shall' be allowed an extra teacher. We have every reason to be proud of our school program in which minds and bodies have been successfully developed. We hope that handicraft can take an increasingly important place in the lives of boys and girls while they are at our school, and we are laying plans to bring this about, In my five years on the committee, I have heard repeated discussions of the necessity of adding courses in art and music. I think that this year may see our plans take definite form in putting these in the school curriculum. After visiting classes on my trips to the school, and seeing the vivid interest displayed by pupils in their studies, 3 6 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW I feel that if we give additional opportunities to these children, they will be eagerly seized. Besides this, if we are to market handicraft of these mountain people, we should give the children some training in color and line, so that as they grow older they may develop their sense of the beautiful and fitting, and produce increasingly fine work. To speak of the school brings up necessarily the health work which is done with the pupils. We have always tried to educate both adults and children along sanitary and health lines, and through inoculations and clinics we have brought up the standard of living in the community until we have practically eliminated such diseases as hookworm, typhoid, and even diphtheria. Marjorie Chalmers, R.N., as head of this department for the past five years, has been not only efficient, but sympathetic and understanding. The county is able to furnish little but serums, so in reality we supply a county nurse. Her days are always full, but when an epidemic of flu strikes the community, we wonder at the number of her calls each day. The question of sanitation in the village and outlying districts is an increasingly urgent one since tourists have flocked into the town, and at present there is always potential danger of an epidemic if there happens to be a long dry spell. Town waterworks are a necessity if this is to be avoided. The group of buildings on our hundred acres vary in age from the old one, housing arts and crafts, to the gracious new Arrowcraft shop, and as their age varies, their need of repairs, and maintenance varies. The older buildings require an increasingly greater amount in the budget for repairs and improvements, while of course, the newer ones demand less. The "budget" how brief the word looks, but what hours of study it exacts from the committee at their annual meeting! Donations are uncertain always, but needs remain constant or increase. This year our receipts from clubs and chapters will fall below what we counted upon, and we are thankful that magazine subscriptions have sold so well. Under Beatrice Purdunn's capable direction, the magazine agency shows an increased profit of $865 over last year. This year we are adding to our buildings, through the generosity of Anne Stuart, Nebraska )3, who left a bequest of $10,000, a new Stuart Cottage for use as a boys' dormitory. Barber and McMurray, the architects of our attractive new Arrowcraft shop, have drawn plans for a modern, two-story structure which can accommodate eight boys and two teachers, to replace the old frame dormitory. Two other Pi Phis have been generous, too, in naming the Settlement School as beneficiary in their wills: Mary Rosestengell Ross, Wisconsin A, from whose estate we will receive approximately $370, and Sue Graham Walsh, Colorado A, whose bequest will amount to about $320. The committee will decide at their meeting this June just how this money can best be used, since neither donor specified to what purpose it should be put, but we are indeed grateful for having the school re-membered. In charge of the buildings which house the sixteen dormitory students, and superintending them in their work about the place, is Miss Annette Morse, Illinois A. Her duties are various, but in spite of the demands on her time, she has managed to add to the furnishings and build up the supply of bedding by her thrifty mending and wise expenditure. Arrowcraft continues to be a successful business. So many Settlement School chairmen have reported how and why it has developed, that I shall not go into its past history. Two factors have contributed largely to its success. One of these is theunforeseen chance which opened one of the most popular of the national parks at our front door, and the other the wise selection as Director of Arrowcraft, Mrs. Ethel Weaver Snow, Iowa For the past seven years, by the sound business judgment, and able handling of her department, she has caused Arrowcraft to maintain a steady development. The volume of business has increased from year to year, due in part to the tourist trade, but also to a great extent because of our club sales. We have two shops in Gatlinburg, one under the supervision of Mrs. Snow, and the other in the Mountain View Hotel managed by Mrs. Georgia Duffield who, as has been said before, sells II B 1 with every article. "Miss Georgia" is noteworthy, also for her church and community interest. Our weaving supervisor, Winogene Redding, has contributed to the development of the business, through her wise buying of raw materials, appealing design of the woven articles, and tactful management of her ninety-five weavers. Nor ought to be overlooked the part which those efficient and attractive local girls, Edna and Bess McCarter, and Lura Oweneby, play in building up Arrowcraft. The first year in our new building shows the wisdom of our venture, for this year's sales have set a high level for all time. Beautifully designed, it attracts the eye of all tourists. A problem which has arisen this year and which holds serious potential difficulty for us, is the revision of the present Wage and Hour Act to include a code for workers weaving in their own homes. All members of the different weaving guilds will be affected by any increase in scale of pay, so, after an investigator of the Labor Department had visited the various shops, they decided to unite in furnishing correct information and statistics, in hope that such a radical increase might not he written into the law as to put them out of business. At the meeting of the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild, our Gene Redding was chosen to represent them in Washington, if need occurs, to appear at hearings there. Of course, there has been a great deal of correspondence on this matter, but all sent out by us has been submitted to the Fraternity's lawyers for their approval. No definite action has been taken as yet by the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor, and we hope that the matter can be adjusted satisfactorily without jeopardizing our Gatlinburg industry. In the emergency caused by the illness of Mrs. Weaver and her subsequent resignation, the whole staff carried on nobly. It was thought best by the committee to place temporarily in charge of the management of the school, the heads of the three departments: Mrs. Snow of Arrowcraft, Mrs. Chalmers of the health department, and Miss Annette Morse, our house manager and house mother. With Mrs. Snow as chairman, this group of three has had to deal with the problems which arose. In view of the critical situation, it was voted that I should make a special visit in April after Mrs. Weaver left, and give such advice and aid as I THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 37 could to help them organize the work. After spending a week there, I left with the comfortable assurance that everyone was doing her best to keep the school running as usual. Later in May we were fortunate enough to have the former Chair-man of the Settlement School Committee, Lillian Beck Holton, spend a week there as she returned from the Gamma Province Conference in South Carolina. Her calm judgment and excellent advice was never more valued than in this time of stress at the school. We of the Committee appreciated greatly her taking the time and trouble to make the visit. There have been changes in our staff other than in replacing the Director. Our competent and versatile bookkeeper, Frances Brown, Missouri r, resigned after three years of able service at the school. She is being replaced temporarily by Miss Alice Kiburtz, but we still have to find a II 13 cl, accountant who can fill the position. We have in the past few days voted to put in as Director of the School, Mrs. Elizabeth Comstock Peck, California B, whom we feel is well able to fill the position. Having not only been a business woman, but also a housekeeper and mother, she will doubtless be capable of dealing with the diverse problems which arise at the school. She arrives to take her new position early in June, and we feel sure that her pleasant personality and efficient training will make her a most capable Director. This year there are also changes on the Settlement School Committee, two of us rounding out our terms of five years. Jeffries Green Pace, who has furnished the interesting material for "News from Little Pigeon," is retiring this year, as am I. We both voice a great sadness at completing our term of office. However, the three members who are going on with the work make a most competent nucleus for the new board. Ethel Hogan Copp, California Gamma, who has been our secretary, will be the new chairman, and being five feet of dynamic energy, she will carry on the school management most successfully. Irene Eldridge, Wisconsin B, continues as treasurer, taking charge of all donations from Pi Phis, checking the work of the bookkeeper at the school, and in short, supervising all the financial affairs of the school. Beth Brainerd Le Roy, Massachusetts A, has been in charge of publicity and the routing of the films this year. We have kept in constant touch with each other by correspondence and sometimes telegraph, discussing the problems which have arisen since our annual meeting last July. As Chairman of the Committee, I made the usual winter visit to the school to see that the recommendations made by the committee were being carried out, and that the budget was being followed. At this time I, of course, had no idea that a second trip would be necessary. In being chairman of a standing committee, I have been delighted to see how efficiently the work of the Fraternity at large is being carried on. Although the contact member of the committee is the Grand President, I have found that all members of Grand Council have taken a great interest in the work of the school. In the beginning of this report, I spoke of the changes, expansion, and policies in the school. We have now come to consideration of these latter, present and future. Each year at the Committee meeting we pause to consider seriously how the school is developing, that we may make our actions in the right direction. Not only does the welfare of the community have to be considered, but also the wishes of all Pi Phis. When we are in Gatlinburg, listening to reports and informal discussions by staff and townspeople, it is a far simpler thing to know how they feel than to entertain your thoughts and desires about the school. Pi Phis bring back varying reports, according to the extent of their contacts during their stay. One of them may speed in over the highway, reach a hotel at nightfall, after dinner walk up the Neon-lighted main street to our Arrowcraft shop where she examines the stock with interest and asks some questions about the school and town, then leaves early the next morning. Another, however, comes for a stay of a day or two, in which time she makes a leisurely tour of the whole school plant, takes a hike or horseback trip over the mountain trails into the sparsely settled districts just outside of the Burg, and talks to everyone she meets. Each of these receives different impressions of the life and needs of the community, and their re-ports conflict. Some of these visitors have questioned the advisability of our continuing our work in the face of the growing sophistication of Gatlinburg, and to these I replied in the May ARROW. Because the needs reached by us have changed in character does not lessen their importance or number or our responsibility. The future of the school, like the future of many other things in our changing world, does not stretch clearly before us. The wisdom of curtailment or expansion, of shifts in curriculum, or of changes in policy, has to be reached after much discussion and investigation in committee meeting, and after all, may not prove to be wisdom. In the year intervening between meetings, trends may alter the whole school picture, as they reflect state and national changes. Decisions may be made which are impossible to carry out, or greatly delayed in putting into effect. For instance, it was agreed, in keeping with our desire to let these mountain people assume responsibility as their ability to do so increases, that the community would soon be able to house their elementary school instead of using our building and paying us rent as it has done heretofore. However, we find this will take time, as the process of transference is an involved one, necessitating adoption by the town of a resolution to erect a building, appearance before the legislature in their biannual meeting to get permission to float a bond issue, and ability to sell those bonds. So, in ending this 1941 report, I wish to ask as all chairmen before me have asked your continued support of our school, not only financially but in enthusiastic interest and sympathetic understanding. The tributes paid to our philanthropy by outsiders should give us fine assurance as to its lasting value as a memorial to our Founders. Respectfully submitted, MARIE B.

EAR MESDAMES: We have examined the records maintained by e Treasurer of your Committee for the Pi !ta Phi Settlement School for the fiscal year Lded June 30, 1941. With the data drawn DM these records we have combined the report .epared by Homer K. Jones and Company, pub-: accountants, from the subsidiary records kept / the School and its Arrowcraft Shop at Gatlburg, Tennessee, and we submit herewith the suiting attached statements. In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet Ld related statements of income and surplus Arent fairly the financial position of the Pi Beta Settlement School at June 30, 1941, and the come and expenses for the fiscal year then ended, bject to the extent of our own verification, which indicated above did not include the Gatlinburg cords. We examined and tested the income from Club Ld Chapter contributions, which are shown in dell in Schedule 3-a, and from magazine agencies Ld we found adequate support and authorization / the expenditures made directly by the Treaser. The cash balances at Milwaukee were verid by us. The endowment securities and cash, :cept cash in transit, were certified to by the arris Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago, Trus-.s for the endowment funds, and this Trustee's port was accepted without further verification cept that we checked the accounting made of anges in .investments and the income from se-rides and found it in good order. COMMENTS rsh Balances The cash balances at June 30, 1941, exclusive of 5h with the Endowment Trustees or in transit, n.sisted of the following: ilwaukee Accounts: First Wisconsin National Bank Treasurer's checking account $17,772.62 First Wisconsin National Bank Treasurer's savings account 1,040.22 ttlinburg School Accounts: Sevier County Bank School check ing account 116.69 Sevier County Bank House checking account 138.09 Sevier County Bank Arts and Crafts account 52.30 alinburg Arrow Craft Accounts: Sevier County Bank Checking ac count 2,660.05 Bank of Sevierville Savings account 3,018.75 Hamilton National Bank Savings ac count 6,133.62 Morris Plan Bank Savings account. Petty cash funds at Gatlinburg Total $37,158.35 As indicated above, we verified the balances in Milwaukee accounts while those at Sevierville or Knoxville were verified by Homer K. Jones and Company, according to their report. Accounts Receivable The Arrowcraft accounts receivable at June 30, 1941 amounted to $6,548.23 and were due principally from alumnae clubs. These accounts, which we did not verify, were listed in the report of Homer K. Jones and Company, and were $2,712.14 less than those at the close of the previous year. Fixed Assets Expenditures for additions to buildings, equipment, and landscaping amounted to $1,980.27 for the year under review. These expenditures are classified in Schedule 2. Depreciation of the buildings and equipment, computed at rates used in the past, totaled $3,072.46 as shown in the same schedule. Included in the income for 1940-1941 is a bequest of $9,250.00 which we are informed by your Treasurer was designated for building purposes and we understand that a building is now under construction which will absorb this amount but no expenditures for this purpose had been recorded prior to the close of the year. Endowment The only changes in the endowment principal for the year under review consisted of the three-fourths appropriation from chapter contributions of $1,404.75 offset to a considerable extent by losses on securities of $876.96, the fund showing a net increase of $527.79. The security losses were due to writing off a worthless bond of $1,000.00, the securities which were redeemed or sold actually yielding a profit of $123.04. No amortization of bond premiums is charged 'against income by the Trustee although the securities on hand cost $1,788.64 more than par value. These securities are listed in Schedule 1. Current Income and Expenses The income of the Settlement School exceeded operating expenses by $7,017.34 while the Arrow-craft net profit totaled $14,103.08. The Settlement School income, however, included the bequest of $9,250.00 for building purposes as pointed out above. On the other hand the expenses included depreciation of $3,072.46, a large part of which is attributable to operation of the Arrowcraft shops and stores. The Arrowcraft net income was approximately $3,300.00 greater than that of the previous year, the sales totaling $54,545.35 as compared to $42,951.03 for 1939-1940. The percentage of gross profit on sales was not quite as favorable for the current year as it was for 1939-1940.

The driveway has been changed to the side of the house with parking space toward the rear. This gives a solid expanse of lawn in front. Native shrubs surround it. One of the Park men helped us with the landscaping. The little rustic bridge at the side has been moved up the creek a few feet so that the school children do not cross the corner there. With a few more additions on the interior it should be complete. Hardly a customer fails to exclaim over its beauty. Taking it month by month through the year business has been consistently better. The amount of returns remained about the same but they were sent back earlier in the year as a whole. One particular club so far out-distanced all the rest this year they should be mentioned in this report. Berkeley up to June 1 has sold $1,911.80 with the month of June to bring it up to two thousand. The next highest sales record was the New York Club with $970.94. Dallas was a close third. To spoil that picture there is over $5,800 out-standing on our books against clubs. This represents unsold goods or failure to send in money promptly. I am still in hopes the month of June will clear up a great deal of that as our books go SCHOOL URING these last weeks of school Mrs. Weaver has been sorely missed. Perhaps I can give you a brief outline of some of the things that have happened. The grade school was out the latter part of April and the following teachers have been elected for next school year. Mr. Pern Price of. Gatlinburg will remain as Principal. Pauline Sharp, Eleanor Brabson, and Veryl Elder will return from the County. Doris Hatch, Illinois A and Flora Belle De Witt, Colorado B, will also return to us in the Fall. Due to the marriage of Ruth Parker and the resignation of Pauline Morris there will be two new Pi Phis to take their places, Mary Hayward, Arizona A, and Sue Viering, Illinois A. Mr. King, who has been Superintendent for ten years, tendered his resignation. Mr. Fleming will take his place. Cleo Nelson, North Dakota A, has also resigned. Miriam Moore, Kansas B, will be to an auditor the first day of July. The Fall Guild meeting was just over the mountain at the Cherokee Indian Reservation in North Carolina. The spring meeting was in Knoxville as usual, followed by a meeting of Southern Highlanders Inc. at Norris in the afternoon. The Southeastern Arts Association was meeting in Knoxville at the same time. A great number of our things were in their display. Besides attending those three meetings I have visited the John C. Campbell Folk School this past year. The Guild Shop in Asheville has done so well through the years that it was decided to use part of the small surplus to start another shop in the Shenandoah National Park. Arrowcraft, as a member, will have that as another market. We have already had several re-orders but it is too early to know if they will be able to sell as much as Allan-stand has for us. In making out a recent report I find that one third is sold as cash sales to the passing tourists, one sixth wholesale to other shops through the country, and one half by our own alumnae clubs and active chapters. That is a grand record to have kept through the years. Respectfully submitted, ETHEL WEAVER SNOW the Pi Phi to take her place. The new County teacher on the High School staff is to be Margaret Burchfield of Sevierville. -She is graduating with high honors from the University of Tennessee and will go on to summer school to finish her Library training so that she may have charge of the School Library along with her other work. The County board allowed us enough money for one other high school teacher this coming year. It has to be some one who can teach chemistry and I am still hoping some outstanding Pi Phi will offer her services. There is also a position open to a Pi Phi who knows double entry bookkeeping. Mrs. Elizabeth Peck, California B, comes to us very soon as the new Director. The rest of the school staff remains the same. Their reports will speak for themselves. Respectfully submitted, ETHEL WEAVER SNOW \ i \ T EPO Convention, June 21-27, 1942, New Ocean House, Swampscott, Mass. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW WEAVING DEPA ow that the Arrowcraft fiscal year for 1941 is about to pass into history, we can say hat we have produced more weaving during this han in any previous year. We have had a total of 7 women weaving for us which is not our highest ecord but they have earned more during the year han any other group. This year in the eleven aonths ending May 1941 they have earned 12,636.35. In the same period a year ago they tad earned $10,114.27 or a gain of $2,522.08. In )ecember 1940 we reached an all-time high for ,ne month when we paid the weavers $3,196.68. 'he weavers have shown their same loyalty and ooperation throughout the year that they always D. The play "Store Britches," the most ambitious indertaking the Weaver's Guild has ever atempted, was a decided success. The two casts gave 7 performances during the summer tourist season. 'he play was enthusiastically received by those vho saw it. The proceeds of the final performance vere given to the Gatlinburg Public Library and hey also gave $25.00 to the. Red Cross. Five veavers have borrowed from the fund to get ;lasses, one to pipe water into her house, and one a pay for an x-ray of her husband's stomach. They are planning to give the play again as a wrist attraction during July and August with the lea in mind of making it an annual affair whose hief value would be to keep alive in an authentic lay a bit of the fast-disappearing type of mountain amily life. This year the play will be under the omplete direction of Mrs. Phillip Maxwell. The greatest and most serious development as ar as our weaving is concerned during the year 3 the effect that the application of the Fair Labor tandards Act may have. The Southern Highland landicraft Guild has been carrying on negotiaions with the U. S. Department of Labor since 1st March. As this will affect not only Arrowcraft ut all handicraft organizations of the country qually, the Directors of the Guild thought that here is strength in unity and that we would get urther with the negotiations to have the Guild aembers represented as a whole rather than inividually. It is on. this basis that Arrowcraft has been ,articipating. All reports and correspondence that ve sent to Washington have been submitted to 4iss Onken or Mrs. Hagee first for approval. At the request of the Guild last March, as they were anticipating the investigation from Washagton anyway, the Hearings /Branch of the U. S. )epartment of Labor sent one of their staff memers to the annual meeting of the Guild in Knox-file. She stayed in the region three weeks making TMENT 1940-41 an extensive study of the work and set-up of the important centers in which Guild members were located. She stayed four days in Gatlinburg and visited not only Arrowcraft but the other shops as well, as they would have to comply with the law if they are in Interstate Commerce. This would automatically eliminate the price competition with which we have always been faced locally. Because hand-loom weaving would be the most difficult handicraft to readjust, a committee representing the important weaving members of the Guild was appointed with myself as chairman, to make an exhaustive study of weaving that is done in the homes and paid by the piece. This study included not only the producing but the marketing of weaving. The committee met in Gatlinburg on April 18 with seven weaving centers represented. The report of their findings has not yet been sent to the Department of Labor as they are still working on some of the questions that were sent to them by the Department of Labor to be studied. At the present time nothing definite has been decided and the issue is still in the hands of the President of the Guild and the Department of Labor. The future selling prices of weaving are hard to predict with the uncertainty that is attached both to the advancing of the prices for materials and the probable application to handicrafts of the Wage and Hour Act. I have tried to safeguard as much as possible against the continuous advance in the price of materials by buying in quantity supplies of wool and linen before the rise took place. This is only a temporary advantage for as long as the war lasts, prices will continue to change. Wool has gone up recently and linen has already advanced over 100% with the supply uncertain. We have on hand enough staple linen to last us 8 to 12 more months and wool to last 6 to 8 months at our present rate of production with but few additional purchases. Cotton prices have not advanced materially as yet. This will necessarily mean increasing our selling prices on many of the woven articles and the cautious weaving of all our linens. It would help our weaving program tremendously this fall if the Clubs would not over-estimate the linens they will need for their sales and order on the hand-to-mouth plan. Everything that we do not have to weave will conserve our supply of materials that cannot be replaced at the prices we paid for them. I hesitate to overstock in face of the uncertain times ahead. Respectfully submitted, WINOGENE B. REDDING PRINCIPAL'S ANNUAL EPO T, 1940.41 1st' THE 1940-41 school year opened on Tuesday after Labor Day, with the brightest promise of very successful school year. The opening day's nrollment was the largest on record for the high chool, and both pupils and teachers seemed nxious to get down to work. The teaching staff was composed of: William wing, principal, History and Social Science; Ben qeming, Mathematics, Science, and Coach; Cleo Nelson, English and Librarian; William Coe, Vocational Agriculture; Charlotte Herman, Vocational Home Economics; and William Oakes, Vocational Handicrafts. Miss Nelson and Miss Herman, the new members of the staff, while lacking in experience, worked hard at the job and the high school ran along as smoothly as could be expected. The large enrollment made a longer school day THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 49 necessary as more classes had to be taught by the same teaching force. The school day was lengthened from six to eight periods, and the length of the periods changed from sixty to forty-five minutes. A new course in Biology was introduced for the sophomore class and Sociology was added for the seniors. The course of study this year consisted of: English, four units; Science, three units; History, and Social Science, four units; Mathematics, three units; Vocational Agriculture, three units; Vocational Home Economics, three units, and Handicrafts, one unit; a total of twenty-one classes daily. The high school enrollment showed a consider-able increase of the preceding year. This rate of increase will probably continue for two more years and then will level off, unless school busses are added to bring students from other communities.

They won thirteen games and lost JENNIE N][COL MEMO TWENTY years ago, the Jennie Nicol Memorial Health Center moved into the little white cottage that had been the home of the Andrew Ogle family. Through the years of service and friendly understanding, the few cases of the beginning years have grown to hundreds. Methods change as need arises, but the pioneers builded well, and the policies have changed but little. One of the most important phases of the work of the Health Center, is the care of the maternity cases. Twenty-six mothers were on the records for the year, most of whom were under the super-vision of some doctor. Advice on diet and exercise, lists and articles for layettes, preparation for home delivery or for hospitalization were given. Regular check of weight and general condition were kept as often as possible. Some of the new babies had regular nursing care for a few days, and some as well as older babies had formulas or diets regulated as necessary. Many of them have been in for the Friday after-noon clinics many times. One premature baby was fed with a medicine dropper for several days, until she was strong enough to nurse, and kept in a warmed basket in lieu of an incubator. One baby developed pneumonia, with supplementary infection, and lived but twenty-four hours, in spite of every treatment that could be suggested by the specialists in Knoxville. An oxygen tank was even borrowed from a service station and an inhalation mask devised from a paper sack, all to no avail. Henry, aged two and a half, and nearly blind from an attack of meningitis the year previous, one during the regular playing season, and went to the semi-finals in the district tournament. Four-teen players were awarded letters at the close of the season. The Settlement School staff put on the play "Who's Crazy Now" to a large and appreciative audience. The purpose of the play was to raise money for a moving picture machine for the school. The junior class presented a play in the fall and the senior class gave two plays to raise money for their trip to Washington. The trip of the senior class to the nation's capital, was one of the high lights of the school year for the seniors. They worked all year to make the necessary money for transportation. They had a five day trip, going to Washington by way of Natural Bridge and the Skyline Drive. They spent two days sightseeing in Washington and returned home by way of Yorktown, Norfolk, and Virginia Beach. The various clubs of the school had a very active year. The Home Economics club and the FFA furnished much of the social life of the school. The glee club under the direction of Mrs. Chalmers and Miss Nelson furnished the music for commencement. Dr. Stewart W. McClelland, President of , Lincoln Memorial University, delivered the commencement address, and Rev. W. D. Wilkinson preached the Baccalaureate sermon. Twenty seniors received their diplomas. Respectfully submitted, WILLIAM KING, Principal IAL HEALTH CENTE had an eye examination by Dr. Robert Leech of Knoxville. The child seems to do little more than distinguish light from darkness, and there seems little hope of any improvement. Probably at some later date, he may be placed in some school for some sort of training. Little red-headed Marjorie, whose left foot was straightened by Dr. Bagwell, is walking freely. Six months old Margaret has both tiny legs in casts for club foot correction. She is a patient of the Crippled Children's Clinic, and reports there on alternate Fridays for observation, change of cast or treatment. The Crippled Children's work is done under the auspices of the Sevier County Post of the American Legion, and by state funds. School inspections were held at intervals during the year at Gatlinburg, and at the six rural schools. Inoculations for typhoid, diphtheria, and small pox were made as necessary in each place. Talks pertaining to health were ,made in class rooms and in other meetings. The general health of the school children seems to be improving year by year. Fewer are underweight, due to supervised lunches, and increased knowledge of both parents and children. The Sevierville Lions Club has bought glasses for several children of the district, and r sorority aids in the correction of defects. A number of children had tonsils removed, a few had appendectomies, and many visited the dentist. There were innumerable dressings, a few fractures, and many sprains. But the high light of the school health program is the lessening of the old enemy, impetigo. Better living conditions, more balanced 10 \ 50 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW diet, and persistence of treatment, are undoubtedly responsible. Community nursing consists mostly of emergency or special treatment. Post-operative dressings, massage, hypodermics, irrigations, and instruction in home nursing. Several were taken to Cancer or Tuberculosis Clinics, and for X-rays. Three doctors in Sevierville have infirmaries, and rapid ambulance service has made it possible to transport patients quickly and safely. The Loan Closet continues to be of great service. Crutches, rubber sheeting, bed pans, hot water bottles, and ice caps are borrowed in case of need, and returned for the use of others. Night clothing for children and adults, and baby things are used again and again. As always, we are grateful for the cooperation met on every side, from the doctors who so freely give advice and aid, the members of the staff, and of the Fraternity. Above all, we are grateful for the friendship and appreciation of the people of the community. The work of the Health Center seems to go beyond mere physical needs. Worry and unhappiness are as tangible as disease, and a tonic for the ELEMENTA THE Ij[ B (1, Elementary School opened on September 3, 1940 with the following teachers: Eleanor Brabson, primer; Doris Hatch, first grade; Ruth Parker, second grade; Veryle Elder, third grade; Pauline Morris, fourth grade; Pauline Sharp, fifth grade; Flora Belle DeWitt, sixth and seventh grades ; C. Pern Price, eighth grade. For the seventh consecutive year the II B Elementary School has won the cup in the Blue Ribbon contest for the larger schools. This is quite a distinction as no other school in the county, large or small, can equal this record. For the second year the elementary school has been given a rating of 100% in the sanitation program. We are one of the twelve schools in the county to make this record. A number of books for our library were given to us by friends from Muncie, Indiana. Most all system no more necessary than a tonic for morale. It is our sincere hope that the Health Center may continue to stand for those things, whatever they may be, that will make life happier and more healthful for our people.

MARJORIE CHALMERS, R.N. Y SCHOOL the books were fiction. On April 8, 1941, the faculty of the high school and elementary school gave a play, "Who's Crazy Now." In addition to the faculty Mrs. Snow and Miss Redding took part. The purpose of this play was to take the proceeds and apply on a 16 mm. motion picture machine for use of the school. The enrollment for 1940-41 was 285. The average daily attendance was 225. Inattendance, "flu" and other reasons kept this lower than it should have been. The elementary school had its first football team. Out of five games played they did not lose a game and had their goal line crossed only twice during the season. The largest eighth grade class to finish school in the elementary department finished this year. C. PERN PRICE HANDICRAFTS FoR my report I am giving you an exact list of the articles that were made by the high school group for the past year. There were fourteen in this group that finished this year. Five were seniors and nine juniors. There were five of this group who took other classes during this class period. Some few of them came in the afternoons to make some of this time up. I never had the entire group in the shop at the same time. I could not give the organized work that I should have given, because of this. There were some few that be-came quite skilled. If they could go on with this work, they could accomplish something. As it is they can't take another year because they have had two vocational credits and can have only four to graduate. This course gives two. All of the equipment is in first class order. There have been only a few tools lost. A handsaw, hammer, and a pair of side cutting pliers disappeared while the plumbers were here. Every member of the group this year made an article for the school, to be left here. Many thanks for the job and the many favors, Sincerely, WILLIAM O. OAKES HOME ECONOMICS DEPARTMENT ORTY-SEVEN girls were enrolled in Home five were freshmen, ten were sophomores, and FEconomks the largest number in the history twelve were juniors. The seniors were unable to of the Settlement School. Of this group, twentytake Home Economics as an elective because it THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 51 conflicted with their required courses. In the freshman class, the most popular units were those in clothing construction. The girls made simple blouses, skirts, and aprons in the fall to learn how to use the sewing machine and how to follow a commercial pattern. Some of the girls had sewed considerably at home so each girl chose a clothing problem according to her own skill level so that she could learn something new in her class project. At the end of the six weeks' unit in sewing, the class judged the dresses, and on this basis, two achievement awards were made. The awards were pins given by a commercial pattern company. The girls were very proud of their prizes. During the first semester, we also studied personal grooming, etiquette, and breakfast preparation and service. In October, the freshmen gave an afternoon tea for their mothers and the school staff. This was the climax of their study of manners, introductions, and the art of being a hostess. During the foods units the girls were divided into families for the purpose of working together in planning and preparing the food. Each family served a breakfast in early December, inviting one of the elementary school teachers as guest. In the second semester the freshmen studied child care and development, using their own brothers and sisters at home for observation; preparation and serving of luncheons; school lunches; and food for outdoor hikes and picnics. The sophomore class seemed to be most interested in the foods units. In our first unit food preservation, we canned tomatoes, and apple sauce, and made orange marmalade and apple jelly. As a result of this study, two of the girls made jelly for home projects. Awards similar to those the freshmen received were given the sophomores on the completion of their fall wool dresses. The weaving for the sophomores worked out very well this year because there was an even number of girls in the class so that each pair could work on one loom. Three of our six weeks were spent in making the warps and in setting up the looms for weaving. Each girl then wove a sampler, a towel, and a pillow top. While half the girls were weaving, the others were sewing on baby garments for the American Red Cross. Other units that the sophomores studied included: elements of nutrition, personal grooming, and luncheon preparation and service. 0 MITO THE year of 1940-41 has been a very busy one. As in any household, looking back, it is hard to say what has been accomplished. The culinary department has been taken care of by Belle Lowe and Mrs. Lurie Hurst, and the necessary upkeep such as mending, new curtains, helping the boys and girls, has fallen to me. Two of our girls left us in April to ride the bus to school, but I replaced them by another. The juniors were especially interested in individual development, so our year's work was planned along that line. The first semester they studied personality improvement, personal grooming, clothing budgets and wardrobes, and clothing construction. Two of the girls made wool suits, several made afternoon dresses, and the others made wool school dresses. One week was spent in the, study of vocations for girls. Nursing, office work, and elementary school teaching were especially interesting to the class. The second semester the juniors took up special party cookery, food and health, textiles, clothing construction, and outdoor cookery. At Christmas time, the sophomores planned the menu, decorated, and served the annual dinner for the faculty. The juniors were in charge of food preparation. This spring the juniors planned and prepared the food for the F.F.A. boys and their parents, and the freshmen and sophomores decorated and served. Ninety guests were served in the general science laboratory. Four girls went to the Open House at the University of Tennessee. One junior modelled a two-piece wool dress and a sophomore modelled a spring skirt and jerkin. In March, the juniors took a field trip to Knoxville to visit the furniture stores, after studying about the different types of furnishings suitable for their own homes. Each girl completed three home projects, in addition to her class work. Sewing seemed to be the most popular type of project. Among the projects were: quilts, baby and children's clothes, curtains, pillow cases, slip covers for chairs, and all types of clothes for the girls themselves. Some of the food projects were: baking; preparation of breakfasts, luncheons, and suppers; and a study of pastries. The Home Economics Club had fifty-five members this year. Bi-weekly meetings were held, with programs planned by the girls at each meeting. From November through March, the Home Economics teacher and the Agriculture teacher con-ducted a joint class for adult men and women at the Laurel Grove School in Wear's Valley. The classes met an hour and a half every two weeks. Among the topics discussed for women were: home gardens, menu planning, food and health, and canning. Respectfully submitted, CHARLOTTE HERMAN MS, 1940-41 I have bought five unfinished dressers for th, girls' dormitory and finished them, and had tit floor in the dining room sanded and waxed, an( with Mrs. Hagee's assistance bought a linoleun rug for "Miss Georgic's" room. I would recommend that the kitchen be painted and if it is possible that an electric mixer b purchased for the kitchen. Respectfully submitted, ANNETTE MORSE 5 2 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE ALL DAY CLASSES: This year's enrollment in this group reached a total of fifty-one boys. Three classes were taught in Vocational Agriculture. These classes consisted of twenty-five freshman boys, another class was made up of seventeen sophomores and still another consisted of eight iunior and senior boys. This year we had thirty-four of the fifty-one beginning boys to complete the entire school year. The remaining thirty-foul boys are at present conducting complete supervised Farming Programs. EVENING SCHOOL CLASSES: One night school was conducted in the Laurel Grove Community for those men who are established in the business of farming. This adult class I teach at least one night out of each month and this continues throughout the year. This year we had seventeen meetings with a total of fifty-three farmers enrolled. Our course of study is based on the needs of the community. We made surveys to determine what were the farming and living conditions of the Laurel Grove Community. After spending one class meeting in a discussion of our data, the farmers came to the conclusion that their greatest problem was low income. Farmers were then led to set up objectives which would increase their farm income. They were: 1. To increase soil fertility through (a) liming (b) phosphating (c) rotating crops (d) growing winter cover crops 2. To provide livestock of good type to consume all feed produced on the farm. 3. To produce the home food supply on the farm as nearly as possible. 4. To improve the farm home and its surroundings through (a) providing electric lights and running water in the home. (b) repairing the farm home. (c) improving the home grounds. PART-TIME CLASSES: This year one class was taught to a group of out-of-school boys at Camp Morgan, the CCC camp which is located five miles away from the school. I met with this group of thirty-two boys one night each week to study problems pertaining to farming. These boys as a group have three projects on the camp grounds: 1. Poultry 2. Bees 3. Rabbits On January 1 of this year, there came aid through the Sevier County Board of Education to provide National Defense Training for out-ofschool rural and urban youth. The supervision of these .classes became the job of the Vocational Agriculture Teachers throughout the State. Our School provided two of these classes to this group. One of these was taught by Mr. Walter Cardwell in woodworking, in which twenty-five boys were enrolled. The other class is now being taught at Pigeon Forge Elementary School House by Mr. Fred Cooper. This course is in elementary electricity, in which twenty students are enrolled. It is hoped that these boys will be better able to do the necessary jobs in preparation for war or in time of war. We have an improved Farm Shop as a result of this training. We now have $264.00 worth of additional equipment for our farm shop. We think this equipment will become the property of Sevier County Board of Education and this will be left with the Agricultural Department of our School. THE FFA CHAPTER: The Future Farmers of America chapter has completed a most successful year. We have taken part in the following outside activities of the School: 1. Showing Dairy Cattle at the County Fair. 2. Exhibiting Farm products, farmshop work, and poultry at the County Fair and at the Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial Fair at Knoxville. 3. Sponsored FFA and Home Economics socials. 4. Livestock and Dairy cattle judging contest at the University of Tennessee in which sixty-eight high school chapters of FFA competed. (Pi Phi won third place in Livestock and Roy McCarter, a senior FFA boy, was high point contestant of the whole contest in which 209 boys entered.) 5. Sponsored Third Annual Parent and Son Banquet. (FFA boys invited their mothers and fathers. Eighty-seven parents and guests attended.) 6. Public Speaking contest at University. (Roy Ogle, a senior FFA boy, placed second in the 5th district which had 14 chapters competing.) 7. FFA Baseball and Basketball teams. 8. Presentation of the FFA cup to best All-around high school girl. 9. Two boys continue to produce Hybrid corn for seed. Last year one boy sold $224.00 worth of seed corn harvested from one acre. 10. Four town boys who are taking agriculture have rented land from the airport and have what appears to be successful Home Gar-dens. Some of these boys have in addition, Home Improvement, and twenty-five to fifty chicks for broilers. 11. CAMP CLEMENTS Five boys and I at-tended the Tennessee FFA camp for one week last summer. (Pi Phi won the athletic award for that week's activities.) 12. FFA field day, the last Saturday in April, found us competing in field meets at Powell Station High School, Knox County, with FFA chapters of the 5th district. The boys did well in the events, but their total points were not enough to surpass the Powell Station FFA. 13. RADIO PROGRAMS. This year the Pi Beta Phi FFA sponsored two programs over WNOX. The first program was presented by four boys who were growing Hybrid corn for seed. The Title of the program was GROWING HYBRID CORN. Our second program was entitled THE AGRICULTURAL CONDITION OF SEVIER . COUNTY AND HOW THE VOCATION-AL AGRICULTURE AT PI BETA PHI PLAYS ITS PART. This program was given by four senior FFA boys. 14. Tennessee FFA Convention was attended THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 53 by five boys and myself in Memphis, Tennessee, April 25 and 26. Our chapter was presented with the camp award, mentioned as a third place winner of the Livestock Judging contest and also that Roy McCarter from II B (1) had made the highest number of points of any boy in the East Tennessee Livestock judging contest. Dot Fox, a junior, and also a Hybrid Corn Grower, was awarded the degree of the Tennessee State planter. Dot plans to try to become an American farmer within the next two years. The fifth district of FFA offered three money awards to the best supervised farming program conducted by a boy last year. Dot won the second prize and the first prize went to a University of Tennessee Freshman boy of the college of agriculture. THE SCHOOL FARM: This year we had eight boys in the Dormitory who did the work on the farm and janitor work in the school houses. Six of these boys took Vocational Agriculture. They were given charge of certain enterprises in which they were responsible in their work. This causes the boy to take more interest in his work and thus a better job is done. Last fall our Jerseys, poultry, hogs, and farm products placed well at our County Fair. We had the Grand Champion animal of the Jersey Show. This year we have 140 white Leghorn hens in our laying flock. 100 white Leghorn sexed baby chicks were bought for replacements in the laying flock next fall. 800 baby chicks were bought and fed to broiler weight for Dining hall and to sell to the hotel. Mountain View Hotel uses all of our extra broilers which we produce and gives us a good price for them. Two modern brooder houses were constructed on the farm by agriculture boys as a part of their training in Agriculture. A water line was laid from the Boys' Dormitory to the incubator house. This makes it possible for us to provide ample water for livestock at the barn without having to carry it. As to the financial standing of the farm I pre-sent the following: Month Sold to Farm Farm Kitchen Expense Receipts July $ 229.09 $ 6.95 $ 37.93 August 194.36 412.23 4.00 September 145.69 80.71 2.00 October 205.49 152.68 23.35 November 145.25 273.76 36.16 December 141.01 254.62 19.00 January 157.52 3.88 64.48 February 150.05 273.92 72.10 March 264.51 90.22 April 236.69 155.81 27.63 May 175.20 336.78 247.62 Total $2,044.86 $2,052.45 $534.27 Sold to kitchen plus cash income $2,579.13 Total income less expenses 526.68 ).

        3 6 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW I feel that if we give additional opportunities to these children, they will be eagerly seized. Besides this, if we are to market handicraft of these mountain people, we should give the children some training in color and line, so that as they grow older they may develop their sense of the beautiful and fitting, and produce increasingly fine work. To speak of the school brings up necessarily the health work which is done with the pupils. We have always tried to educate both adults and children along sanitary and health lines, and through inoculations and clinics we have brought up the standard of living in the community until we have practically eliminated such diseases as hookworm, typhoid, and even diphtheria. Marjorie Chalmers, R.N., as head of this department for the past five years, has been not only efficient, but sympathetic and understanding. The county is able to furnish little but serums, so in reality we supply a county nurse. Her days are always full, but when an epidemic of flu strikes the community, we wonder at the number of her calls each day. The question of sanitation in the village and outlying districts is an increasingly urgent one since tourists have flocked into the town, and at present there is always potential danger of an epidemic if there happens to be a long dry spell. Town waterworks are a necessity if this is to be avoided. The group of buildings on our hundred acres vary in age from the old one, housing arts and crafts, to the gracious new Arrowcraft shop, and as their age varies, their need of repairs, and maintenance varies. The older buildings require an increasingly greater amount in the budget for repairs and improvements, while of course, the newer ones demand less. The "budget" how brief the word looks, but what hours of study it exacts from the committee at their annual meeting! Donations are uncertain always, but needs remain constant or increase. This year our receipts from clubs and chapters will fall below what we counted upon, and we are thankful that magazine subscriptions have sold so well. Under Beatrice Purdunn's capable direction, the magazine agency shows an increased profit of $865 over last year. This year we are adding to our buildings, through the generosity of Anne Stuart, Nebraska )3, who left a bequest of $10,000, a new Stuart Cottage for use as a boys' dormitory. Barber and McMurray, the architects of our attractive new Arrowcraft shop, have drawn plans for a modern, two-story structure which can accommodate eight boys and two teachers, to replace the old frame dormitory. Two other Pi Phis have been generous, too, in naming the Settlement School as beneficiary in their wills: Mary Rosestengell Ross, Wisconsin A, from whose estate we will receive approximately $370, and Sue Graham Walsh, Colorado A, whose bequest will amount to about $320. The committee will decide at their meeting this June just how this money can best be used, since neither donor specified to what purpose it should be put, but we are indeed grateful for having the school re-membered. In charge of the buildings which house the sixteen dormitory students, and superintending them in their work about the place, is Miss Annette Morse, Illinois A. Her duties are various, but in spite of the demands on her time, she has managed to add to the furnishings and build up the supply of bedding by her thrifty mending and wise expenditure. Arrowcraft continues to be a successful business. So many Settlement School chairmen have reported how and why it has developed, that I shall not go into its past history. Two factors have contributed largely to its success. One of these is theunforeseen chance which opened one of the most popular of the national parks at our front door, and the other the wise selection as Director of Arrowcraft, Mrs. Ethel Weaver Snow, Iowa For the past seven years, by the sound business judgment, and able handling of her department, she has caused Arrowcraft to maintain a steady development. The volume of business has increased from year to year, due in part to the tourist trade, but also to a great extent because of our club sales. We have two shops in Gatlinburg, one under the supervision of Mrs. Snow, and the other in the Mountain View Hotel managed by Mrs. Georgia Duffield who, as has been said before, sells II B 1 with every article. "Miss Georgia" is noteworthy, also for her church and community interest. Our weaving supervisor, Winogene Redding, has contributed to the development of the business, through her wise buying of raw materials, appealing design of the woven articles, and tactful management of her ninety-five weavers. Nor ought to be overlooked the part which those efficient and attractive local girls, Edna and Bess McCarter, and Lura Oweneby, play in building up Arrowcraft. The first year in our new building shows the wisdom of our venture, for this year's sales have set a high level for all time. Beautifully designed, it attracts the eye of all tourists. A problem which has arisen this year and which holds serious potential difficulty for us, is the revision of the present Wage and Hour Act to include a code for workers weaving in their own homes. All members of the different weaving guilds will be affected by any increase in scale of pay, so, after an investigator of the Labor Department had visited the various shops, they decided to unite in furnishing correct information and statistics, in hope that such a radical increase might not he written into the law as to put them out of business. At the meeting of the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild, our Gene Redding was chosen to represent them in Washington, if need occurs, to appear at hearings there. Of course, there has been a great deal of correspondence on this matter, but all sent out by us has been submitted to the Fraternity's lawyers for their approval. No definite action has been taken as yet by the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor, and we hope that the matter can be adjusted satisfactorily without jeopardizing our Gatlinburg industry. In the emergency caused by the illness of Mrs. Weaver and her subsequent resignation, the whole staff carried on nobly. It was thought best by the committee to place temporarily in charge of the management of the school, the heads of the three departments: Mrs. Snow of Arrowcraft, Mrs. Chalmers of the health department, and Miss Annette Morse, our house manager and house mother. With Mrs. Snow as chairman, this group of three has had to deal with the problems which arose. In view of the critical situation, it was voted that I should make a special visit in April after Mrs. Weaver left, and give such advice and aid as I THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 37 could to help them organize the work. After spending a week there, I left with the comfortable assurance that everyone was doing her best to keep the school running as usual. Later in May we were fortunate enough to have the former Chair-man of the Settlement School Committee, Lillian Beck Holton, spend a week there as she returned from the Gamma Province Conference in South Carolina. Her calm judgment and excellent advice was never more valued than in this time of stress at the school. We of the Committee appreciated greatly her taking the time and trouble to make the visit. There have been changes in our staff other than in replacing the Director. Our competent and versatile bookkeeper, Frances Brown, Missouri r, resigned after three years of able service at the school. She is being replaced temporarily by Miss Alice Kiburtz, but we still have to find a II 13 cl, accountant who can fill the position. We have in the past few days voted to put in as Director of the School, Mrs. Elizabeth Comstock Peck, California B, whom we feel is well able to fill the position. Having not only been a business woman, but also a housekeeper and mother, she will doubtless be capable of dealing with the diverse problems which arise at the school. She arrives to take her new position early in June, and we feel sure that her pleasant personality and efficient training will make her a most capable Director. This year there are also changes on the Settlement School Committee, two of us rounding out our terms of five years. Jeffries Green Pace, who has furnished the interesting material for "News from Little Pigeon," is retiring this year, as am I. We both voice a great sadness at completing our term of office. However, the three members who are going on with the work make a most competent nucleus for the new board. Ethel Hogan Copp, California Gamma, who has been our secretary, will be the new chairman, and being five feet of dynamic energy, she will carry on the school management most successfully. Irene Eldridge, Wisconsin B, continues as treasurer, taking charge of all donations from Pi Phis, checking the work of the bookkeeper at the school, and in short, supervising all the financial affairs of the school. Beth Brainerd Le Roy, Massachusetts A, has been in charge of publicity and the routing of the films this year. We have kept in constant touch with each other by correspondence and sometimes telegraph, discussing the problems which have arisen since our annual meeting last July. As Chairman of the Committee, I made the usual winter visit to the school to see that the recommendations made by the committee were being carried out, and that the budget was being followed. At this time I, of course, had no idea that a second trip would be necessary. In being chairman of a standing committee, I have been delighted to see how efficiently the work of the Fraternity at large is being carried on. Although the contact member of the committee is the Grand President, I have found that all members of Grand Council have taken a great interest in the work of the school. In the beginning of this report, I spoke of the changes, expansion, and policies in the school. We have now come to consideration of these latter, present and future. Each year at the Committee meeting we pause to consider seriously how the school is developing, that we may make our actions in the right direction. Not only does the welfare of the community have to be considered, but also the wishes of all Pi Phis. When we are in Gatlinburg, listening to reports and informal discussions by staff and townspeople, it is a far simpler thing to know how they feel than to entertain your thoughts and desires about the school. Pi Phis bring back varying reports, according to the extent of their contacts during their stay. One of them may speed in over the highway, reach a hotel at nightfall, after dinner walk up the Neon-lighted main street to our Arrowcraft shop where she examines the stock with interest and asks some questions about the school and town, then leaves early the next morning. Another, however, comes for a stay of a day or two, in which time she makes a leisurely tour of the whole school plant, takes a hike or horseback trip over the mountain trails into the sparsely settled districts just outside of the Burg, and talks to everyone she meets. Each of these receives different impressions of the life and needs of the community, and their re-ports conflict. Some of these visitors have questioned the advisability of our continuing our work in the face of the growing sophistication of Gatlinburg, and to these I replied in the May ARROW. Because the needs reached by us have changed in character does not lessen their importance or number or our responsibility. The future of the school, like the future of many other things in our changing world, does not stretch clearly before us. The wisdom of curtailment or expansion, of shifts in curriculum, or of changes in policy, has to be reached after much discussion and investigation in committee meeting, and after all, may not prove to be wisdom. In the year intervening between meetings, trends may alter the whole school picture, as they reflect state and national changes. Decisions may be made which are impossible to carry out, or greatly delayed in putting into effect. For instance, it was agreed, in keeping with our desire to let these mountain people assume responsibility as their ability to do so increases, that the community would soon be able to house their elementary school instead of using our building and paying us rent as it has done heretofore. However, we find this will take time, as the process of transference is an involved one, necessitating adoption by the town of a resolution to erect a building, appearance before the legislature in their biannual meeting to get permission to float a bond issue, and ability to sell those bonds. So, in ending this 1941 report, I wish to ask as all chairmen before me have asked your continued support of our school, not only financially but in enthusiastic interest and sympathetic understanding. The tributes paid to our philanthropy by outsiders should give us fine assurance as to its lasting value as a memorial to our Founders. Respectfully submitted, MARIE B.

EAR MESDAMES: We have examined the records maintained by e Treasurer of your Committee for the Pi !ta Phi Settlement School for the fiscal year Lded June 30, 1941. With the data drawn DM these records we have combined the report .epared by Homer K. Jones and Company, pub-: accountants, from the subsidiary records kept / the School and its Arrowcraft Shop at Gatlburg, Tennessee, and we submit herewith the suiting attached statements. In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet Ld related statements of income and surplus Arent fairly the financial position of the Pi Beta Settlement School at June 30, 1941, and the come and expenses for the fiscal year then ended, bject to the extent of our own verification, which indicated above did not include the Gatlinburg cords. We examined and tested the income from Club Ld Chapter contributions, which are shown in dell in Schedule 3-a, and from magazine agencies Ld we found adequate support and authorization / the expenditures made directly by the Treaser. The cash balances at Milwaukee were verid by us. The endowment securities and cash, :cept cash in transit, were certified to by the arris Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago, Trus-.s for the endowment funds, and this Trustee's port was accepted without further verification cept that we checked the accounting made of anges in .investments and the income from se-rides and found it in good order. COMMENTS rsh Balances The cash balances at June 30, 1941, exclusive of 5h with the Endowment Trustees or in transit, n.sisted of the following: ilwaukee Accounts: First Wisconsin National Bank Treasurer's checking account $17,772.62 First Wisconsin National Bank Treasurer's savings account 1,040.22 ttlinburg School Accounts: Sevier County Bank School check ing account 116.69 Sevier County Bank House checking account 138.09 Sevier County Bank Arts and Crafts account 52.30 alinburg Arrow Craft Accounts: Sevier County Bank Checking ac count 2,660.05 Bank of Sevierville Savings account 3,018.75 Hamilton National Bank Savings ac count 6,133.62 Morris Plan Bank Savings account. Petty cash funds at Gatlinburg Total $37,158.35 As indicated above, we verified the balances in Milwaukee accounts while those at Sevierville or Knoxville were verified by Homer K. Jones and Company, according to their report. Accounts Receivable The Arrowcraft accounts receivable at June 30, 1941 amounted to $6,548.23 and were due principally from alumnae clubs. These accounts, which we did not verify, were listed in the report of Homer K. Jones and Company, and were $2,712.14 less than those at the close of the previous year. Fixed Assets Expenditures for additions to buildings, equipment, and landscaping amounted to $1,980.27 for the year under review. These expenditures are classified in Schedule 2. Depreciation of the buildings and equipment, computed at rates used in the past, totaled $3,072.46 as shown in the same schedule. Included in the income for 1940-1941 is a bequest of $9,250.00 which we are informed by your Treasurer was designated for building purposes and we understand that a building is now under construction which will absorb this amount but no expenditures for this purpose had been recorded prior to the close of the year. Endowment The only changes in the endowment principal for the year under review consisted of the three-fourths appropriation from chapter contributions of $1,404.75 offset to a considerable extent by losses on securities of $876.96, the fund showing a net increase of $527.79. The security losses were due to writing off a worthless bond of $1,000.00, the securities which were redeemed or sold actually yielding a profit of $123.04. No amortization of bond premiums is charged 'against income by the Trustee although the securities on hand cost $1,788.64 more than par value. These securities are listed in Schedule 1. Current Income and Expenses The income of the Settlement School exceeded operating expenses by $7,017.34 while the Arrow-craft net profit totaled $14,103.08. The Settlement School income, however, included the bequest of $9,250.00 for building purposes as pointed out above. On the other hand the expenses included depreciation of $3,072.46, a large part of which is attributable to operation of the Arrowcraft shops and stores. The Arrowcraft net income was approximately $3,300.00 greater than that of the previous year, the sales totaling $54,545.35 as compared to $42,951.03 for 1939-1940. The percentage of gross profit on sales was not quite as favorable for the current year as it was for 1939-1940.

The driveway has been changed to the side of the house with parking space toward the rear. This gives a solid expanse of lawn in front. Native shrubs surround it. One of the Park men helped us with the landscaping. The little rustic bridge at the side has been moved up the creek a few feet so that the school children do not cross the corner there. With a few more additions on the interior it should be complete. Hardly a customer fails to exclaim over its beauty. Taking it month by month through the year business has been consistently better. The amount of returns remained about the same but they were sent back earlier in the year as a whole. One particular club so far out-distanced all the rest this year they should be mentioned in this report. Berkeley up to June 1 has sold $1,911.80 with the month of June to bring it up to two thousand. The next highest sales record was the New York Club with $970.94. Dallas was a close third. To spoil that picture there is over $5,800 out-standing on our books against clubs. This represents unsold goods or failure to send in money promptly. I am still in hopes the month of June will clear up a great deal of that as our books go SCHOOL URING these last weeks of school Mrs. Weaver has been sorely missed. Perhaps I can give you a brief outline of some of the things that have happened. The grade school was out the latter part of April and the following teachers have been elected for next school year. Mr. Pern Price of. Gatlinburg will remain as Principal. Pauline Sharp, Eleanor Brabson, and Veryl Elder will return from the County. Doris Hatch, Illinois A and Flora Belle De Witt, Colorado B, will also return to us in the Fall. Due to the marriage of Ruth Parker and the resignation of Pauline Morris there will be two new Pi Phis to take their places, Mary Hayward, Arizona A, and Sue Viering, Illinois A. Mr. King, who has been Superintendent for ten years, tendered his resignation. Mr. Fleming will take his place. Cleo Nelson, North Dakota A, has also resigned. Miriam Moore, Kansas B, will be to an auditor the first day of July. The Fall Guild meeting was just over the mountain at the Cherokee Indian Reservation in North Carolina. The spring meeting was in Knoxville as usual, followed by a meeting of Southern Highlanders Inc. at Norris in the afternoon. The Southeastern Arts Association was meeting in Knoxville at the same time. A great number of our things were in their display. Besides attending those three meetings I have visited the John C. Campbell Folk School this past year. The Guild Shop in Asheville has done so well through the years that it was decided to use part of the small surplus to start another shop in the Shenandoah National Park. Arrowcraft, as a member, will have that as another market. We have already had several re-orders but it is too early to know if they will be able to sell as much as Allan-stand has for us. In making out a recent report I find that one third is sold as cash sales to the passing tourists, one sixth wholesale to other shops through the country, and one half by our own alumnae clubs and active chapters. That is a grand record to have kept through the years. Respectfully submitted, ETHEL WEAVER SNOW the Pi Phi to take her place. The new County teacher on the High School staff is to be Margaret Burchfield of Sevierville. -She is graduating with high honors from the University of Tennessee and will go on to summer school to finish her Library training so that she may have charge of the School Library along with her other work. The County board allowed us enough money for one other high school teacher this coming year. It has to be some one who can teach chemistry and I am still hoping some outstanding Pi Phi will offer her services. There is also a position open to a Pi Phi who knows double entry bookkeeping. Mrs. Elizabeth Peck, California B, comes to us very soon as the new Director. The rest of the school staff remains the same. Their reports will speak for themselves. Respectfully submitted, ETHEL WEAVER SNOW \ i \ T EPO Convention, June 21-27, 1942, New Ocean House, Swampscott, Mass. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW WEAVING DEPA ow that the Arrowcraft fiscal year for 1941 is about to pass into history, we can say hat we have produced more weaving during this han in any previous year. We have had a total of 7 women weaving for us which is not our highest ecord but they have earned more during the year han any other group. This year in the eleven aonths ending May 1941 they have earned 12,636.35. In the same period a year ago they tad earned $10,114.27 or a gain of $2,522.08. In )ecember 1940 we reached an all-time high for ,ne month when we paid the weavers $3,196.68. 'he weavers have shown their same loyalty and ooperation throughout the year that they always D. The play "Store Britches," the most ambitious indertaking the Weaver's Guild has ever atempted, was a decided success. The two casts gave 7 performances during the summer tourist season. 'he play was enthusiastically received by those vho saw it. The proceeds of the final performance vere given to the Gatlinburg Public Library and hey also gave $25.00 to the. Red Cross. Five veavers have borrowed from the fund to get ;lasses, one to pipe water into her house, and one a pay for an x-ray of her husband's stomach. They are planning to give the play again as a wrist attraction during July and August with the lea in mind of making it an annual affair whose hief value would be to keep alive in an authentic lay a bit of the fast-disappearing type of mountain amily life. This year the play will be under the omplete direction of Mrs. Phillip Maxwell. The greatest and most serious development as ar as our weaving is concerned during the year 3 the effect that the application of the Fair Labor tandards Act may have. The Southern Highland landicraft Guild has been carrying on negotiaions with the U. S. Department of Labor since 1st March. As this will affect not only Arrowcraft ut all handicraft organizations of the country qually, the Directors of the Guild thought that here is strength in unity and that we would get urther with the negotiations to have the Guild aembers represented as a whole rather than inividually. It is on. this basis that Arrowcraft has been ,articipating. All reports and correspondence that ve sent to Washington have been submitted to 4iss Onken or Mrs. Hagee first for approval. At the request of the Guild last March, as they were anticipating the investigation from Washagton anyway, the Hearings /Branch of the U. S. )epartment of Labor sent one of their staff memers to the annual meeting of the Guild in Knox-file. She stayed in the region three weeks making TMENT 1940-41 an extensive study of the work and set-up of the important centers in which Guild members were located. She stayed four days in Gatlinburg and visited not only Arrowcraft but the other shops as well, as they would have to comply with the law if they are in Interstate Commerce. This would automatically eliminate the price competition with which we have always been faced locally. Because hand-loom weaving would be the most difficult handicraft to readjust, a committee representing the important weaving members of the Guild was appointed with myself as chairman, to make an exhaustive study of weaving that is done in the homes and paid by the piece. This study included not only the producing but the marketing of weaving. The committee met in Gatlinburg on April 18 with seven weaving centers represented. The report of their findings has not yet been sent to the Department of Labor as they are still working on some of the questions that were sent to them by the Department of Labor to be studied. At the present time nothing definite has been decided and the issue is still in the hands of the President of the Guild and the Department of Labor. The future selling prices of weaving are hard to predict with the uncertainty that is attached both to the advancing of the prices for materials and the probable application to handicrafts of the Wage and Hour Act. I have tried to safeguard as much as possible against the continuous advance in the price of materials by buying in quantity supplies of wool and linen before the rise took place. This is only a temporary advantage for as long as the war lasts, prices will continue to change. Wool has gone up recently and linen has already advanced over 100% with the supply uncertain. We have on hand enough staple linen to last us 8 to 12 more months and wool to last 6 to 8 months at our present rate of production with but few additional purchases. Cotton prices have not advanced materially as yet. This will necessarily mean increasing our selling prices on many of the woven articles and the cautious weaving of all our linens. It would help our weaving program tremendously this fall if the Clubs would not over-estimate the linens they will need for their sales and order on the hand-to-mouth plan. Everything that we do not have to weave will conserve our supply of materials that cannot be replaced at the prices we paid for them. I hesitate to overstock in face of the uncertain times ahead. Respectfully submitted, WINOGENE B. REDDING PRINCIPAL'S ANNUAL EPO T, 1940.41 1st' THE 1940-41 school year opened on Tuesday after Labor Day, with the brightest promise of very successful school year. The opening day's nrollment was the largest on record for the high chool, and both pupils and teachers seemed nxious to get down to work. The teaching staff was composed of: William wing, principal, History and Social Science; Ben qeming, Mathematics, Science, and Coach; Cleo Nelson, English and Librarian; William Coe, Vocational Agriculture; Charlotte Herman, Vocational Home Economics; and William Oakes, Vocational Handicrafts. Miss Nelson and Miss Herman, the new members of the staff, while lacking in experience, worked hard at the job and the high school ran along as smoothly as could be expected. The large enrollment made a longer school day THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 49 necessary as more classes had to be taught by the same teaching force. The school day was lengthened from six to eight periods, and the length of the periods changed from sixty to forty-five minutes. A new course in Biology was introduced for the sophomore class and Sociology was added for the seniors. The course of study this year consisted of: English, four units; Science, three units; History, and Social Science, four units; Mathematics, three units; Vocational Agriculture, three units; Vocational Home Economics, three units, and Handicrafts, one unit; a total of twenty-one classes daily. The high school enrollment showed a consider-able increase of the preceding year. This rate of increase will probably continue for two more years and then will level off, unless school busses are added to bring students from other communities.

They won thirteen games and lost JENNIE N][COL MEMO TWENTY years ago, the Jennie Nicol Memorial Health Center moved into the little white cottage that had been the home of the Andrew Ogle family. Through the years of service and friendly understanding, the few cases of the beginning years have grown to hundreds. Methods change as need arises, but the pioneers builded well, and the policies have changed but little. One of the most important phases of the work of the Health Center, is the care of the maternity cases. Twenty-six mothers were on the records for the year, most of whom were under the super-vision of some doctor. Advice on diet and exercise, lists and articles for layettes, preparation for home delivery or for hospitalization were given. Regular check of weight and general condition were kept as often as possible. Some of the new babies had regular nursing care for a few days, and some as well as older babies had formulas or diets regulated as necessary. Many of them have been in for the Friday after-noon clinics many times. One premature baby was fed with a medicine dropper for several days, until she was strong enough to nurse, and kept in a warmed basket in lieu of an incubator. One baby developed pneumonia, with supplementary infection, and lived but twenty-four hours, in spite of every treatment that could be suggested by the specialists in Knoxville. An oxygen tank was even borrowed from a service station and an inhalation mask devised from a paper sack, all to no avail. Henry, aged two and a half, and nearly blind from an attack of meningitis the year previous, one during the regular playing season, and went to the semi-finals in the district tournament. Four-teen players were awarded letters at the close of the season. The Settlement School staff put on the play "Who's Crazy Now" to a large and appreciative audience. The purpose of the play was to raise money for a moving picture machine for the school. The junior class presented a play in the fall and the senior class gave two plays to raise money for their trip to Washington. The trip of the senior class to the nation's capital, was one of the high lights of the school year for the seniors. They worked all year to make the necessary money for transportation. They had a five day trip, going to Washington by way of Natural Bridge and the Skyline Drive. They spent two days sightseeing in Washington and returned home by way of Yorktown, Norfolk, and Virginia Beach. The various clubs of the school had a very active year. The Home Economics club and the FFA furnished much of the social life of the school. The glee club under the direction of Mrs. Chalmers and Miss Nelson furnished the music for commencement. Dr. Stewart W. McClelland, President of , Lincoln Memorial University, delivered the commencement address, and Rev. W. D. Wilkinson preached the Baccalaureate sermon. Twenty seniors received their diplomas. Respectfully submitted, WILLIAM KING, Principal IAL HEALTH CENTE had an eye examination by Dr. Robert Leech of Knoxville. The child seems to do little more than distinguish light from darkness, and there seems little hope of any improvement. Probably at some later date, he may be placed in some school for some sort of training. Little red-headed Marjorie, whose left foot was straightened by Dr. Bagwell, is walking freely. Six months old Margaret has both tiny legs in casts for club foot correction. She is a patient of the Crippled Children's Clinic, and reports there on alternate Fridays for observation, change of cast or treatment. The Crippled Children's work is done under the auspices of the Sevier County Post of the American Legion, and by state funds. School inspections were held at intervals during the year at Gatlinburg, and at the six rural schools. Inoculations for typhoid, diphtheria, and small pox were made as necessary in each place. Talks pertaining to health were ,made in class rooms and in other meetings. The general health of the school children seems to be improving year by year. Fewer are underweight, due to supervised lunches, and increased knowledge of both parents and children. The Sevierville Lions Club has bought glasses for several children of the district, and r sorority aids in the correction of defects. A number of children had tonsils removed, a few had appendectomies, and many visited the dentist. There were innumerable dressings, a few fractures, and many sprains. But the high light of the school health program is the lessening of the old enemy, impetigo. Better living conditions, more balanced 10 \ 50 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW diet, and persistence of treatment, are undoubtedly responsible. Community nursing consists mostly of emergency or special treatment. Post-operative dressings, massage, hypodermics, irrigations, and instruction in home nursing. Several were taken to Cancer or Tuberculosis Clinics, and for X-rays. Three doctors in Sevierville have infirmaries, and rapid ambulance service has made it possible to transport patients quickly and safely. The Loan Closet continues to be of great service. Crutches, rubber sheeting, bed pans, hot water bottles, and ice caps are borrowed in case of need, and returned for the use of others. Night clothing for children and adults, and baby things are used again and again. As always, we are grateful for the cooperation met on every side, from the doctors who so freely give advice and aid, the members of the staff, and of the Fraternity. Above all, we are grateful for the friendship and appreciation of the people of the community. The work of the Health Center seems to go beyond mere physical needs. Worry and unhappiness are as tangible as disease, and a tonic for the ELEMENTA THE Ij[ B (1, Elementary School opened on September 3, 1940 with the following teachers: Eleanor Brabson, primer; Doris Hatch, first grade; Ruth Parker, second grade; Veryle Elder, third grade; Pauline Morris, fourth grade; Pauline Sharp, fifth grade; Flora Belle DeWitt, sixth and seventh grades ; C. Pern Price, eighth grade. For the seventh consecutive year the II B Elementary School has won the cup in the Blue Ribbon contest for the larger schools. This is quite a distinction as no other school in the county, large or small, can equal this record. For the second year the elementary school has been given a rating of 100% in the sanitation program. We are one of the twelve schools in the county to make this record. A number of books for our library were given to us by friends from Muncie, Indiana. Most all system no more necessary than a tonic for morale. It is our sincere hope that the Health Center may continue to stand for those things, whatever they may be, that will make life happier and more healthful for our people.

MARJORIE CHALMERS, R.N. Y SCHOOL the books were fiction. On April 8, 1941, the faculty of the high school and elementary school gave a play, "Who's Crazy Now." In addition to the faculty Mrs. Snow and Miss Redding took part. The purpose of this play was to take the proceeds and apply on a 16 mm. motion picture machine for use of the school. The enrollment for 1940-41 was 285. The average daily attendance was 225. Inattendance, "flu" and other reasons kept this lower than it should have been. The elementary school had its first football team. Out of five games played they did not lose a game and had their goal line crossed only twice during the season. The largest eighth grade class to finish school in the elementary department finished this year. C. PERN PRICE HANDICRAFTS FoR my report I am giving you an exact list of the articles that were made by the high school group for the past year. There were fourteen in this group that finished this year. Five were seniors and nine juniors. There were five of this group who took other classes during this class period. Some few of them came in the afternoons to make some of this time up. I never had the entire group in the shop at the same time. I could not give the organized work that I should have given, because of this. There were some few that be-came quite skilled. If they could go on with this work, they could accomplish something. As it is they can't take another year because they have had two vocational credits and can have only four to graduate. This course gives two. All of the equipment is in first class order. There have been only a few tools lost. A handsaw, hammer, and a pair of side cutting pliers disappeared while the plumbers were here. Every member of the group this year made an article for the school, to be left here. Many thanks for the job and the many favors, Sincerely, WILLIAM O. OAKES HOME ECONOMICS DEPARTMENT ORTY-SEVEN girls were enrolled in Home five were freshmen, ten were sophomores, and FEconomks the largest number in the history twelve were juniors. The seniors were unable to of the Settlement School. Of this group, twentytake Home Economics as an elective because it THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 51 conflicted with their required courses. In the freshman class, the most popular units were those in clothing construction. The girls made simple blouses, skirts, and aprons in the fall to learn how to use the sewing machine and how to follow a commercial pattern. Some of the girls had sewed considerably at home so each girl chose a clothing problem according to her own skill level so that she could learn something new in her class project. At the end of the six weeks' unit in sewing, the class judged the dresses, and on this basis, two achievement awards were made. The awards were pins given by a commercial pattern company. The girls were very proud of their prizes. During the first semester, we also studied personal grooming, etiquette, and breakfast preparation and service. In October, the freshmen gave an afternoon tea for their mothers and the school staff. This was the climax of their study of manners, introductions, and the art of being a hostess. During the foods units the girls were divided into families for the purpose of working together in planning and preparing the food. Each family served a breakfast in early December, inviting one of the elementary school teachers as guest. In the second semester the freshmen studied child care and development, using their own brothers and sisters at home for observation; preparation and serving of luncheons; school lunches; and food for outdoor hikes and picnics. The sophomore class seemed to be most interested in the foods units. In our first unit food preservation, we canned tomatoes, and apple sauce, and made orange marmalade and apple jelly. As a result of this study, two of the girls made jelly for home projects. Awards similar to those the freshmen received were given the sophomores on the completion of their fall wool dresses. The weaving for the sophomores worked out very well this year because there was an even number of girls in the class so that each pair could work on one loom. Three of our six weeks were spent in making the warps and in setting up the looms for weaving. Each girl then wove a sampler, a towel, and a pillow top. While half the girls were weaving, the others were sewing on baby garments for the American Red Cross. Other units that the sophomores studied included: elements of nutrition, personal grooming, and luncheon preparation and service. 0 MITO THE year of 1940-41 has been a very busy one. As in any household, looking back, it is hard to say what has been accomplished. The culinary department has been taken care of by Belle Lowe and Mrs. Lurie Hurst, and the necessary upkeep such as mending, new curtains, helping the boys and girls, has fallen to me. Two of our girls left us in April to ride the bus to school, but I replaced them by another. The juniors were especially interested in individual development, so our year's work was planned along that line. The first semester they studied personality improvement, personal grooming, clothing budgets and wardrobes, and clothing construction. Two of the girls made wool suits, several made afternoon dresses, and the others made wool school dresses. One week was spent in the, study of vocations for girls. Nursing, office work, and elementary school teaching were especially interesting to the class. The second semester the juniors took up special party cookery, food and health, textiles, clothing construction, and outdoor cookery. At Christmas time, the sophomores planned the menu, decorated, and served the annual dinner for the faculty. The juniors were in charge of food preparation. This spring the juniors planned and prepared the food for the F.F.A. boys and their parents, and the freshmen and sophomores decorated and served. Ninety guests were served in the general science laboratory. Four girls went to the Open House at the University of Tennessee. One junior modelled a two-piece wool dress and a sophomore modelled a spring skirt and jerkin. In March, the juniors took a field trip to Knoxville to visit the furniture stores, after studying about the different types of furnishings suitable for their own homes. Each girl completed three home projects, in addition to her class work. Sewing seemed to be the most popular type of project. Among the projects were: quilts, baby and children's clothes, curtains, pillow cases, slip covers for chairs, and all types of clothes for the girls themselves. Some of the food projects were: baking; preparation of breakfasts, luncheons, and suppers; and a study of pastries. The Home Economics Club had fifty-five members this year. Bi-weekly meetings were held, with programs planned by the girls at each meeting. From November through March, the Home Economics teacher and the Agriculture teacher con-ducted a joint class for adult men and women at the Laurel Grove School in Wear's Valley. The classes met an hour and a half every two weeks. Among the topics discussed for women were: home gardens, menu planning, food and health, and canning. Respectfully submitted, CHARLOTTE HERMAN MS, 1940-41 I have bought five unfinished dressers for th, girls' dormitory and finished them, and had tit floor in the dining room sanded and waxed, an( with Mrs. Hagee's assistance bought a linoleun rug for "Miss Georgic's" room. I would recommend that the kitchen be painted and if it is possible that an electric mixer b purchased for the kitchen. Respectfully submitted, ANNETTE MORSE 5 2 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE ALL DAY CLASSES: This year's enrollment in this group reached a total of fifty-one boys. Three classes were taught in Vocational Agriculture. These classes consisted of twenty-five freshman boys, another class was made up of seventeen sophomores and still another consisted of eight iunior and senior boys. This year we had thirty-four of the fifty-one beginning boys to complete the entire school year. The remaining thirty-foul boys are at present conducting complete supervised Farming Programs. EVENING SCHOOL CLASSES: One night school was conducted in the Laurel Grove Community for those men who are established in the business of farming. This adult class I teach at least one night out of each month and this continues throughout the year. This year we had seventeen meetings with a total of fifty-three farmers enrolled. Our course of study is based on the needs of the community. We made surveys to determine what were the farming and living conditions of the Laurel Grove Community. After spending one class meeting in a discussion of our data, the farmers came to the conclusion that their greatest problem was low income. Farmers were then led to set up objectives which would increase their farm income. They were: 1. To increase soil fertility through (a) liming (b) phosphating (c) rotating crops (d) growing winter cover crops 2. To provide livestock of good type to consume all feed produced on the farm. 3. To produce the home food supply on the farm as nearly as possible. 4. To improve the farm home and its surroundings through (a) providing electric lights and running water in the home. (b) repairing the farm home. (c) improving the home grounds. PART-TIME CLASSES: This year one class was taught to a group of out-of-school boys at Camp Morgan, the CCC camp which is located five miles away from the school. I met with this group of thirty-two boys one night each week to study problems pertaining to farming. These boys as a group have three projects on the camp grounds: 1. Poultry 2. Bees 3. Rabbits On January 1 of this year, there came aid through the Sevier County Board of Education to provide National Defense Training for out-ofschool rural and urban youth. The supervision of these .classes became the job of the Vocational Agriculture Teachers throughout the State. Our School provided two of these classes to this group. One of these was taught by Mr. Walter Cardwell in woodworking, in which twenty-five boys were enrolled. The other class is now being taught at Pigeon Forge Elementary School House by Mr. Fred Cooper. This course is in elementary electricity, in which twenty students are enrolled. It is hoped that these boys will be better able to do the necessary jobs in preparation for war or in time of war. We have an improved Farm Shop as a result of this training. We now have $264.00 worth of additional equipment for our farm shop. We think this equipment will become the property of Sevier County Board of Education and this will be left with the Agricultural Department of our School. THE FFA CHAPTER: The Future Farmers of America chapter has completed a most successful year. We have taken part in the following outside activities of the School: 1. Showing Dairy Cattle at the County Fair. 2. Exhibiting Farm products, farmshop work, and poultry at the County Fair and at the Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial Fair at Knoxville. 3. Sponsored FFA and Home Economics socials. 4. Livestock and Dairy cattle judging contest at the University of Tennessee in which sixty-eight high school chapters of FFA competed. (Pi Phi won third place in Livestock and Roy McCarter, a senior FFA boy, was high point contestant of the whole contest in which 209 boys entered.) 5. Sponsored Third Annual Parent and Son Banquet. (FFA boys invited their mothers and fathers. Eighty-seven parents and guests attended.) 6. Public Speaking contest at University. (Roy Ogle, a senior FFA boy, placed second in the 5th district which had 14 chapters competing.) 7. FFA Baseball and Basketball teams. 8. Presentation of the FFA cup to best All-around high school girl. 9. Two boys continue to produce Hybrid corn for seed. Last year one boy sold $224.00 worth of seed corn harvested from one acre. 10. Four town boys who are taking agriculture have rented land from the airport and have what appears to be successful Home Gar-dens. Some of these boys have in addition, Home Improvement, and twenty-five to fifty chicks for broilers. 11. CAMP CLEMENTS Five boys and I at-tended the Tennessee FFA camp for one week last summer. (Pi Phi won the athletic award for that week's activities.) 12. FFA field day, the last Saturday in April, found us competing in field meets at Powell Station High School, Knox County, with FFA chapters of the 5th district. The boys did well in the events, but their total points were not enough to surpass the Powell Station FFA. 13. RADIO PROGRAMS. This year the Pi Beta Phi FFA sponsored two programs over WNOX. The first program was presented by four boys who were growing Hybrid corn for seed. The Title of the program was GROWING HYBRID CORN. Our second program was entitled THE AGRICULTURAL CONDITION OF SEVIER . COUNTY AND HOW THE VOCATION-AL AGRICULTURE AT PI BETA PHI PLAYS ITS PART. This program was given by four senior FFA boys. 14. Tennessee FFA Convention was attended THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 53 by five boys and myself in Memphis, Tennessee, April 25 and 26. Our chapter was presented with the camp award, mentioned as a third place winner of the Livestock Judging contest and also that Roy McCarter from II B (1) had made the highest number of points of any boy in the East Tennessee Livestock judging contest. Dot Fox, a junior, and also a Hybrid Corn Grower, was awarded the degree of the Tennessee State planter. Dot plans to try to become an American farmer within the next two years. The fifth district of FFA offered three money awards to the best supervised farming program conducted by a boy last year. Dot won the second prize and the first prize went to a University of Tennessee Freshman boy of the college of agriculture. THE SCHOOL FARM: This year we had eight boys in the Dormitory who did the work on the farm and janitor work in the school houses. Six of these boys took Vocational Agriculture. They were given charge of certain enterprises in which they were responsible in their work. This causes the boy to take more interest in his work and thus a better job is done. Last fall our Jerseys, poultry, hogs, and farm products placed well at our County Fair. We had the Grand Champion animal of the Jersey Show. This year we have 140 white Leghorn hens in our laying flock. 100 white Leghorn sexed baby chicks were bought for replacements in the laying flock next fall. 800 baby chicks were bought and fed to broiler weight for Dining hall and to sell to the hotel. Mountain View Hotel uses all of our extra broilers which we produce and gives us a good price for them. Two modern brooder houses were constructed on the farm by agriculture boys as a part of their training in Agriculture. A water line was laid from the Boys' Dormitory to the incubator house. This makes it possible for us to provide ample water for livestock at the barn without having to carry it. As to the financial standing of the farm I pre-sent the following: Month Sold to Farm Farm Kitchen Expense Receipts July $ 229.09 $ 6.95 $ 37.93 August 194.36 412.23 4.00 September 145.69 80.71 2.00 October 205.49 152.68 23.35 November 145.25 273.76 36.16 December 141.01 254.62 19.00 January 157.52 3.88 64.48 February 150.05 273.92 72.10 March 264.51 90.22 April 236.69 155.81 27.63 May 175.20 336.78 247.62 Total $2,044.86 $2,052.45 $534.27 Sold to kitchen plus cash income $2,579.13 Total income less expenses 526.68 ).

The endowment securities and cash, :cept cash in transit, were certified to by the arris Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago, Trus-.s for the endowment funds, and this Trustee's port was accepted without further verification cept that we checked the accounting made of anges in .investments and the income from se-rides and found it in good order. COMMENTS rsh Balances The cash balances at June 30, 1941, exclusive of 5h with the Endowment Trustees or in transit, n.sisted of the following: ilwaukee Accounts: First Wisconsin National Bank Treasurer's checking account $17,772.62 First Wisconsin National Bank Treasurer's savings account 1,040.22 ttlinburg School Accounts: Sevier County Bank School check ing account 116.69 Sevier County Bank House checking account 138.09 Sevier County Bank Arts and Crafts account 52.30 alinburg Arrow Craft Accounts: Sevier County Bank Checking ac count 2,660.05 Bank of Sevierville Savings account 3,018.75 Hamilton National Bank Savings ac count 6,133.62 Morris Plan Bank Savings account. Petty cash funds at Gatlinburg Total $37,158.35 As indicated above, we verified the balances in Milwaukee accounts while those at Sevierville or Knoxville were verified by Homer K. Jones and Company, according to their report. Accounts Receivable The Arrowcraft accounts receivable at June 30, 1941 amounted to $6,548.23 and were due principally from alumnae clubs. These accounts, which we did not verify, were listed in the report of Homer K. Jones and Company, and were $2,712.14 less than those at the close of the previous year. Fixed Assets Expenditures for additions to buildings, equipment, and landscaping amounted to $1,980.27 for the year under review. These expenditures are classified in Schedule 2. Depreciation of the buildings and equipment, computed at rates used in the past, totaled $3,072.46 as shown in the same schedule. Included in the income for 1940-1941 is a bequest of $9,250.00 which we are informed by your Treasurer was designated for building purposes and we understand that a building is now under construction which will absorb this amount but no expenditures for this purpose had been recorded prior to the close of the year. Endowment The only changes in the endowment principal for the year under review consisted of the three-fourths appropriation from chapter contributions of $1,404.75 offset to a considerable extent by losses on securities of $876.96, the fund showing a net increase of $527.79. The security losses were due to writing off a worthless bond of $1,000.00, the securities which were redeemed or sold actually yielding a profit of $123.04. No amortization of bond premiums is charged 'against income by the Trustee although the securities on hand cost $1,788.64 more than par value. These securities are listed in Schedule 1. Current Income and Expenses The income of the Settlement School exceeded operating expenses by $7,017.34 while the Arrow-craft net profit totaled $14,103.08. The Settlement School income, however, included the bequest of $9,250.00 for building purposes as pointed out above. On the other hand the expenses included depreciation of $3,072.46, a large part of which is attributable to operation of the Arrowcraft shops and stores. The Arrowcraft net income was approximately $3,300.00 greater than that of the previous year, the sales totaling $54,545.35 as compared to $42,951.03 for 1939-1940. The percentage of gross profit on sales was not quite as favorable for the current year as it was for 1939-1940.

The driveway has been changed to the side of the house with parking space toward the rear. This gives a solid expanse of lawn in front. Native shrubs surround it. One of the Park men helped us with the landscaping. The little rustic bridge at the side has been moved up the creek a few feet so that the school children do not cross the corner there. With a few more additions on the interior it should be complete. Hardly a customer fails to exclaim over its beauty. Taking it month by month through the year business has been consistently better. The amount of returns remained about the same but they were sent back earlier in the year as a whole. One particular club so far out-distanced all the rest this year they should be mentioned in this report. Berkeley up to June 1 has sold $1,911.80 with the month of June to bring it up to two thousand. The next highest sales record was the New York Club with $970.94. Dallas was a close third. To spoil that picture there is over $5,800 out-standing on our books against clubs. This represents unsold goods or failure to send in money promptly. I am still in hopes the month of June will clear up a great deal of that as our books go SCHOOL URING these last weeks of school Mrs. Weaver has been sorely missed. Perhaps I can give you a brief outline of some of the things that have happened. The grade school was out the latter part of April and the following teachers have been elected for next school year. Mr. Pern Price of. Gatlinburg will remain as Principal. Pauline Sharp, Eleanor Brabson, and Veryl Elder will return from the County. Doris Hatch, Illinois A and Flora Belle De Witt, Colorado B, will also return to us in the Fall. Due to the marriage of Ruth Parker and the resignation of Pauline Morris there will be two new Pi Phis to take their places, Mary Hayward, Arizona A, and Sue Viering, Illinois A. Mr. King, who has been Superintendent for ten years, tendered his resignation. Mr. Fleming will take his place. Cleo Nelson, North Dakota A, has also resigned. Miriam Moore, Kansas B, will be to an auditor the first day of July. The Fall Guild meeting was just over the mountain at the Cherokee Indian Reservation in North Carolina. The spring meeting was in Knoxville as usual, followed by a meeting of Southern Highlanders Inc. at Norris in the afternoon. The Southeastern Arts Association was meeting in Knoxville at the same time. A great number of our things were in their display. Besides attending those three meetings I have visited the John C. Campbell Folk School this past year. The Guild Shop in Asheville has done so well through the years that it was decided to use part of the small surplus to start another shop in the Shenandoah National Park. Arrowcraft, as a member, will have that as another market. We have already had several re-orders but it is too early to know if they will be able to sell as much as Allan-stand has for us. In making out a recent report I find that one third is sold as cash sales to the passing tourists, one sixth wholesale to other shops through the country, and one half by our own alumnae clubs and active chapters. That is a grand record to have kept through the years. Respectfully submitted, ETHEL WEAVER SNOW the Pi Phi to take her place. The new County teacher on the High School staff is to be Margaret Burchfield of Sevierville. -She is graduating with high honors from the University of Tennessee and will go on to summer school to finish her Library training so that she may have charge of the School Library along with her other work. The County board allowed us enough money for one other high school teacher this coming year. It has to be some one who can teach chemistry and I am still hoping some outstanding Pi Phi will offer her services. There is also a position open to a Pi Phi who knows double entry bookkeeping. Mrs. Elizabeth Peck, California B, comes to us very soon as the new Director. The rest of the school staff remains the same. Their reports will speak for themselves. Respectfully submitted, ETHEL WEAVER SNOW \ i \ T EPO Convention, June 21-27, 1942, New Ocean House, Swampscott, Mass. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW WEAVING DEPA ow that the Arrowcraft fiscal year for 1941 is about to pass into history, we can say hat we have produced more weaving during this han in any previous year. We have had a total of 7 women weaving for us which is not our highest ecord but they have earned more during the year han any other group. This year in the eleven aonths ending May 1941 they have earned 12,636.35. In the same period a year ago they tad earned $10,114.27 or a gain of $2,522.08. In )ecember 1940 we reached an all-time high for ,ne month when we paid the weavers $3,196.68. 'he weavers have shown their same loyalty and ooperation throughout the year that they always D. The play "Store Britches," the most ambitious indertaking the Weaver's Guild has ever atempted, was a decided success. The two casts gave 7 performances during the summer tourist season. 'he play was enthusiastically received by those vho saw it. The proceeds of the final performance vere given to the Gatlinburg Public Library and hey also gave $25.00 to the. Red Cross. Five veavers have borrowed from the fund to get ;lasses, one to pipe water into her house, and one a pay for an x-ray of her husband's stomach. They are planning to give the play again as a wrist attraction during July and August with the lea in mind of making it an annual affair whose hief value would be to keep alive in an authentic lay a bit of the fast-disappearing type of mountain amily life. This year the play will be under the omplete direction of Mrs. Phillip Maxwell. The greatest and most serious development as ar as our weaving is concerned during the year 3 the effect that the application of the Fair Labor tandards Act may have. The Southern Highland landicraft Guild has been carrying on negotiaions with the U. S. Department of Labor since 1st March. As this will affect not only Arrowcraft ut all handicraft organizations of the country qually, the Directors of the Guild thought that here is strength in unity and that we would get urther with the negotiations to have the Guild aembers represented as a whole rather than inividually. It is on. this basis that Arrowcraft has been ,articipating. All reports and correspondence that ve sent to Washington have been submitted to 4iss Onken or Mrs. Hagee first for approval. At the request of the Guild last March, as they were anticipating the investigation from Washagton anyway, the Hearings /Branch of the U. S. )epartment of Labor sent one of their staff memers to the annual meeting of the Guild in Knox-file. She stayed in the region three weeks making TMENT 1940-41 an extensive study of the work and set-up of the important centers in which Guild members were located. She stayed four days in Gatlinburg and visited not only Arrowcraft but the other shops as well, as they would have to comply with the law if they are in Interstate Commerce. This would automatically eliminate the price competition with which we have always been faced locally. Because hand-loom weaving would be the most difficult handicraft to readjust, a committee representing the important weaving members of the Guild was appointed with myself as chairman, to make an exhaustive study of weaving that is done in the homes and paid by the piece. This study included not only the producing but the marketing of weaving. The committee met in Gatlinburg on April 18 with seven weaving centers represented. The report of their findings has not yet been sent to the Department of Labor as they are still working on some of the questions that were sent to them by the Department of Labor to be studied. At the present time nothing definite has been decided and the issue is still in the hands of the President of the Guild and the Department of Labor. The future selling prices of weaving are hard to predict with the uncertainty that is attached both to the advancing of the prices for materials and the probable application to handicrafts of the Wage and Hour Act. I have tried to safeguard as much as possible against the continuous advance in the price of materials by buying in quantity supplies of wool and linen before the rise took place. This is only a temporary advantage for as long as the war lasts, prices will continue to change. Wool has gone up recently and linen has already advanced over 100% with the supply uncertain. We have on hand enough staple linen to last us 8 to 12 more months and wool to last 6 to 8 months at our present rate of production with but few additional purchases. Cotton prices have not advanced materially as yet. This will necessarily mean increasing our selling prices on many of the woven articles and the cautious weaving of all our linens. It would help our weaving program tremendously this fall if the Clubs would not over-estimate the linens they will need for their sales and order on the hand-to-mouth plan. Everything that we do not have to weave will conserve our supply of materials that cannot be replaced at the prices we paid for them. I hesitate to overstock in face of the uncertain times ahead. Respectfully submitted, WINOGENE B. REDDING PRINCIPAL'S ANNUAL EPO T, 1940.41 1st' THE 1940-41 school year opened on Tuesday after Labor Day, with the brightest promise of very successful school year. The opening day's nrollment was the largest on record for the high chool, and both pupils and teachers seemed nxious to get down to work. The teaching staff was composed of: William wing, principal, History and Social Science; Ben qeming, Mathematics, Science, and Coach; Cleo Nelson, English and Librarian; William Coe, Vocational Agriculture; Charlotte Herman, Vocational Home Economics; and William Oakes, Vocational Handicrafts. Miss Nelson and Miss Herman, the new members of the staff, while lacking in experience, worked hard at the job and the high school ran along as smoothly as could be expected. The large enrollment made a longer school day THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 49 necessary as more classes had to be taught by the same teaching force. The school day was lengthened from six to eight periods, and the length of the periods changed from sixty to forty-five minutes. A new course in Biology was introduced for the sophomore class and Sociology was added for the seniors. The course of study this year consisted of: English, four units; Science, three units; History, and Social Science, four units; Mathematics, three units; Vocational Agriculture, three units; Vocational Home Economics, three units, and Handicrafts, one unit; a total of twenty-one classes daily. The high school enrollment showed a consider-able increase of the preceding year. This rate of increase will probably continue for two more years and then will level off, unless school busses are added to bring students from other communities.

They won thirteen games and lost JENNIE N][COL MEMO TWENTY years ago, the Jennie Nicol Memorial Health Center moved into the little white cottage that had been the home of the Andrew Ogle family. Through the years of service and friendly understanding, the few cases of the beginning years have grown to hundreds. Methods change as need arises, but the pioneers builded well, and the policies have changed but little. One of the most important phases of the work of the Health Center, is the care of the maternity cases. Twenty-six mothers were on the records for the year, most of whom were under the super-vision of some doctor. Advice on diet and exercise, lists and articles for layettes, preparation for home delivery or for hospitalization were given. Regular check of weight and general condition were kept as often as possible. Some of the new babies had regular nursing care for a few days, and some as well as older babies had formulas or diets regulated as necessary. Many of them have been in for the Friday after-noon clinics many times. One premature baby was fed with a medicine dropper for several days, until she was strong enough to nurse, and kept in a warmed basket in lieu of an incubator. One baby developed pneumonia, with supplementary infection, and lived but twenty-four hours, in spite of every treatment that could be suggested by the specialists in Knoxville. An oxygen tank was even borrowed from a service station and an inhalation mask devised from a paper sack, all to no avail. Henry, aged two and a half, and nearly blind from an attack of meningitis the year previous, one during the regular playing season, and went to the semi-finals in the district tournament. Four-teen players were awarded letters at the close of the season. The Settlement School staff put on the play "Who's Crazy Now" to a large and appreciative audience. The purpose of the play was to raise money for a moving picture machine for the school. The junior class presented a play in the fall and the senior class gave two plays to raise money for their trip to Washington. The trip of the senior class to the nation's capital, was one of the high lights of the school year for the seniors. They worked all year to make the necessary money for transportation. They had a five day trip, going to Washington by way of Natural Bridge and the Skyline Drive. They spent two days sightseeing in Washington and returned home by way of Yorktown, Norfolk, and Virginia Beach. The various clubs of the school had a very active year. The Home Economics club and the FFA furnished much of the social life of the school. The glee club under the direction of Mrs. Chalmers and Miss Nelson furnished the music for commencement. Dr. Stewart W. McClelland, President of , Lincoln Memorial University, delivered the commencement address, and Rev. W. D. Wilkinson preached the Baccalaureate sermon. Twenty seniors received their diplomas. Respectfully submitted, WILLIAM KING, Principal IAL HEALTH CENTE had an eye examination by Dr. Robert Leech of Knoxville. The child seems to do little more than distinguish light from darkness, and there seems little hope of any improvement. Probably at some later date, he may be placed in some school for some sort of training. Little red-headed Marjorie, whose left foot was straightened by Dr. Bagwell, is walking freely. Six months old Margaret has both tiny legs in casts for club foot correction. She is a patient of the Crippled Children's Clinic, and reports there on alternate Fridays for observation, change of cast or treatment. The Crippled Children's work is done under the auspices of the Sevier County Post of the American Legion, and by state funds. School inspections were held at intervals during the year at Gatlinburg, and at the six rural schools. Inoculations for typhoid, diphtheria, and small pox were made as necessary in each place. Talks pertaining to health were ,made in class rooms and in other meetings. The general health of the school children seems to be improving year by year. Fewer are underweight, due to supervised lunches, and increased knowledge of both parents and children. The Sevierville Lions Club has bought glasses for several children of the district, and r sorority aids in the correction of defects. A number of children had tonsils removed, a few had appendectomies, and many visited the dentist. There were innumerable dressings, a few fractures, and many sprains. But the high light of the school health program is the lessening of the old enemy, impetigo. Better living conditions, more balanced 10 \ 50 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW diet, and persistence of treatment, are undoubtedly responsible. Community nursing consists mostly of emergency or special treatment. Post-operative dressings, massage, hypodermics, irrigations, and instruction in home nursing. Several were taken to Cancer or Tuberculosis Clinics, and for X-rays. Three doctors in Sevierville have infirmaries, and rapid ambulance service has made it possible to transport patients quickly and safely. The Loan Closet continues to be of great service. Crutches, rubber sheeting, bed pans, hot water bottles, and ice caps are borrowed in case of need, and returned for the use of others. Night clothing for children and adults, and baby things are used again and again. As always, we are grateful for the cooperation met on every side, from the doctors who so freely give advice and aid, the members of the staff, and of the Fraternity. Above all, we are grateful for the friendship and appreciation of the people of the community. The work of the Health Center seems to go beyond mere physical needs. Worry and unhappiness are as tangible as disease, and a tonic for the ELEMENTA THE Ij[ B (1, Elementary School opened on September 3, 1940 with the following teachers: Eleanor Brabson, primer; Doris Hatch, first grade; Ruth Parker, second grade; Veryle Elder, third grade; Pauline Morris, fourth grade; Pauline Sharp, fifth grade; Flora Belle DeWitt, sixth and seventh grades ; C. Pern Price, eighth grade. For the seventh consecutive year the II B Elementary School has won the cup in the Blue Ribbon contest for the larger schools. This is quite a distinction as no other school in the county, large or small, can equal this record. For the second year the elementary school has been given a rating of 100% in the sanitation program. We are one of the twelve schools in the county to make this record. A number of books for our library were given to us by friends from Muncie, Indiana. Most all system no more necessary than a tonic for morale. It is our sincere hope that the Health Center may continue to stand for those things, whatever they may be, that will make life happier and more healthful for our people. Following is the summary of the work of the past year, in comparison with that of the pre ceding period. 1939 40 Class of Work 1940 41 Field visits 2,187 1,922 Office calls 2,283 2,349 Surgical dressings 2,002 2,106 Pupil inspections 2,165 2,140 Health talks 69 78 Diphtheria immunization 53 67 Schick tests 49 78 Small pox vacccinations 125 170 *Total typhoid shots 442 1,261 Completed typhoid series 269 400 Other inoculations 163 302 * New state ruling makes it possible to give but one Typhoid inoculation on alternate years after the initial series of three. MARJORIE CHALMERS, R.N. Y SCHOOL the books were fiction. On April 8, 1941, the faculty of the high school and elementary school gave a play, "Who's Crazy Now." In addition to the faculty Mrs. Snow and Miss Redding took part. The purpose of this play was to take the proceeds and apply on a 16 mm. motion picture machine for use of the school. The enrollment for 1940-41 was 285. The average daily attendance was 225. Inattendance, "flu" and other reasons kept this lower than it should have been. The elementary school had its first football team. Out of five games played they did not lose a game and had their goal line crossed only twice during the season. The largest eighth grade class to finish school in the elementary department finished this year. C. PERN PRICE HANDICRAFTS FoR my report I am giving you an exact list of the articles that were made by the high school group for the past year. There were fourteen in this group that finished this year. Five were seniors and nine juniors. There were five of this group who took other classes during this class period. Some few of them came in the afternoons to make some of this time up. I never had the entire group in the shop at the same time. I could not give the organized work that I should have given, because of this. There were some few that be-came quite skilled. If they could go on with this work, they could accomplish something. As it is they can't take another year because they have had two vocational credits and can have only four to graduate. This course gives two. All of the equipment is in first class order. There have been only a few tools lost. A handsaw, hammer, and a pair of side cutting pliers disappeared while the plumbers were here. Every member of the group this year made an article for the school, to be left here. Many thanks for the job and the many favors, Sincerely, WILLIAM O. OAKES HOME ECONOMICS DEPARTMENT ORTY-SEVEN girls were enrolled in Home five were freshmen, ten were sophomores, and FEconomks the largest number in the history twelve were juniors. The seniors were unable to of the Settlement School. Of this group, twentytake Home Economics as an elective because it THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 51 conflicted with their required courses. In the freshman class, the most popular units were those in clothing construction. The girls made simple blouses, skirts, and aprons in the fall to learn how to use the sewing machine and how to follow a commercial pattern. Some of the girls had sewed considerably at home so each girl chose a clothing problem according to her own skill level so that she could learn something new in her class project. At the end of the six weeks' unit in sewing, the class judged the dresses, and on this basis, two achievement awards were made. The awards were pins given by a commercial pattern company. The girls were very proud of their prizes. During the first semester, we also studied personal grooming, etiquette, and breakfast preparation and service. In October, the freshmen gave an afternoon tea for their mothers and the school staff. This was the climax of their study of manners, introductions, and the art of being a hostess. During the foods units the girls were divided into families for the purpose of working together in planning and preparing the food. Each family served a breakfast in early December, inviting one of the elementary school teachers as guest. In the second semester the freshmen studied child care and development, using their own brothers and sisters at home for observation; preparation and serving of luncheons; school lunches; and food for outdoor hikes and picnics. The sophomore class seemed to be most interested in the foods units. In our first unit food preservation, we canned tomatoes, and apple sauce, and made orange marmalade and apple jelly. As a result of this study, two of the girls made jelly for home projects. Awards similar to those the freshmen received were given the sophomores on the completion of their fall wool dresses. The weaving for the sophomores worked out very well this year because there was an even number of girls in the class so that each pair could work on one loom. Three of our six weeks were spent in making the warps and in setting up the looms for weaving. Each girl then wove a sampler, a towel, and a pillow top. While half the girls were weaving, the others were sewing on baby garments for the American Red Cross. Other units that the sophomores studied included: elements of nutrition, personal grooming, and luncheon preparation and service. 0 MITO THE year of 1940-41 has been a very busy one. As in any household, looking back, it is hard to say what has been accomplished. The culinary department has been taken care of by Belle Lowe and Mrs. Lurie Hurst, and the necessary upkeep such as mending, new curtains, helping the boys and girls, has fallen to me. Two of our girls left us in April to ride the bus to school, but I replaced them by another. The juniors were especially interested in individual development, so our year's work was planned along that line. The first semester they studied personality improvement, personal grooming, clothing budgets and wardrobes, and clothing construction. Two of the girls made wool suits, several made afternoon dresses, and the others made wool school dresses. One week was spent in the, study of vocations for girls. Nursing, office work, and elementary school teaching were especially interesting to the class. The second semester the juniors took up special party cookery, food and health, textiles, clothing construction, and outdoor cookery. At Christmas time, the sophomores planned the menu, decorated, and served the annual dinner for the faculty. The juniors were in charge of food preparation. This spring the juniors planned and prepared the food for the F.F.A. boys and their parents, and the freshmen and sophomores decorated and served. Ninety guests were served in the general science laboratory. Four girls went to the Open House at the University of Tennessee. One junior modelled a two-piece wool dress and a sophomore modelled a spring skirt and jerkin. In March, the juniors took a field trip to Knoxville to visit the furniture stores, after studying about the different types of furnishings suitable for their own homes. Each girl completed three home projects, in addition to her class work. Sewing seemed to be the most popular type of project. Among the projects were: quilts, baby and children's clothes, curtains, pillow cases, slip covers for chairs, and all types of clothes for the girls themselves. Some of the food projects were: baking; preparation of breakfasts, luncheons, and suppers; and a study of pastries. The Home Economics Club had fifty-five members this year. Bi-weekly meetings were held, with programs planned by the girls at each meeting. From November through March, the Home Economics teacher and the Agriculture teacher con-ducted a joint class for adult men and women at the Laurel Grove School in Wear's Valley. The classes met an hour and a half every two weeks. Among the topics discussed for women were: home gardens, menu planning, food and health, and canning. Respectfully submitted, CHARLOTTE HERMAN MS, 1940-41 I have bought five unfinished dressers for th, girls' dormitory and finished them, and had tit floor in the dining room sanded and waxed, an( with Mrs. Hagee's assistance bought a linoleun rug for "Miss Georgic's" room. I would recommend that the kitchen be painted and if it is possible that an electric mixer b purchased for the kitchen. Respectfully submitted, ANNETTE MORSE 5 2 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE ALL DAY CLASSES: This year's enrollment in this group reached a total of fifty-one boys. Three classes were taught in Vocational Agriculture. These classes consisted of twenty-five freshman boys, another class was made up of seventeen sophomores and still another consisted of eight iunior and senior boys. This year we had thirty-four of the fifty-one beginning boys to complete the entire school year. The remaining thirty-foul boys are at present conducting complete supervised Farming Programs. EVENING SCHOOL CLASSES: One night school was conducted in the Laurel Grove Community for those men who are established in the business of farming. This adult class I teach at least one night out of each month and this continues throughout the year. This year we had seventeen meetings with a total of fifty-three farmers enrolled. Our course of study is based on the needs of the community. We made surveys to determine what were the farming and living conditions of the Laurel Grove Community. After spending one class meeting in a discussion of our data, the farmers came to the conclusion that their greatest problem was low income. Farmers were then led to set up objectives which would increase their farm income. They were: 1. To increase soil fertility through (a) liming (b) phosphating (c) rotating crops (d) growing winter cover crops 2. To provide livestock of good type to consume all feed produced on the farm. 3. To produce the home food supply on the farm as nearly as possible. 4. To improve the farm home and its surroundings through (a) providing electric lights and running water in the home. (b) repairing the farm home. (c) improving the home grounds. PART-TIME CLASSES: This year one class was taught to a group of out-of-school boys at Camp Morgan, the CCC camp which is located five miles away from the school. I met with this group of thirty-two boys one night each week to study problems pertaining to farming. These boys as a group have three projects on the camp grounds: 1. Poultry 2. Bees 3. Rabbits On January 1 of this year, there came aid through the Sevier County Board of Education to provide National Defense Training for out-ofschool rural and urban youth. The supervision of these .classes became the job of the Vocational Agriculture Teachers throughout the State. Our School provided two of these classes to this group. One of these was taught by Mr. Walter Cardwell in woodworking, in which twenty-five boys were enrolled. The other class is now being taught at Pigeon Forge Elementary School House by Mr. Fred Cooper. This course is in elementary electricity, in which twenty students are enrolled. It is hoped that these boys will be better able to do the necessary jobs in preparation for war or in time of war. We have an improved Farm Shop as a result of this training. We now have $264.00 worth of additional equipment for our farm shop. We think this equipment will become the property of Sevier County Board of Education and this will be left with the Agricultural Department of our School. THE FFA CHAPTER: The Future Farmers of America chapter has completed a most successful year. We have taken part in the following outside activities of the School: 1. Showing Dairy Cattle at the County Fair. 2. Exhibiting Farm products, farmshop work, and poultry at the County Fair and at the Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial Fair at Knoxville. 3. Sponsored FFA and Home Economics socials. 4. Livestock and Dairy cattle judging contest at the University of Tennessee in which sixty-eight high school chapters of FFA competed. (Pi Phi won third place in Livestock and Roy McCarter, a senior FFA boy, was high point contestant of the whole contest in which 209 boys entered.) 5. Sponsored Third Annual Parent and Son Banquet. (FFA boys invited their mothers and fathers. Eighty-seven parents and guests attended.) 6. Public Speaking contest at University. (Roy Ogle, a senior FFA boy, placed second in the 5th district which had 14 chapters competing.) 7. FFA Baseball and Basketball teams. 8. Presentation of the FFA cup to best All-around high school girl. 9. Two boys continue to produce Hybrid corn for seed. Last year one boy sold $224.00 worth of seed corn harvested from one acre. 10. Four town boys who are taking agriculture have rented land from the airport and have what appears to be successful Home Gar-dens. Some of these boys have in addition, Home Improvement, and twenty-five to fifty chicks for broilers. 11. CAMP CLEMENTS Five boys and I at-tended the Tennessee FFA camp for one week last summer. (Pi Phi won the athletic award for that week's activities.) 12. FFA field day, the last Saturday in April, found us competing in field meets at Powell Station High School, Knox County, with FFA chapters of the 5th district. The boys did well in the events, but their total points were not enough to surpass the Powell Station FFA. 13. RADIO PROGRAMS. This year the Pi Beta Phi FFA sponsored two programs over WNOX. The first program was presented by four boys who were growing Hybrid corn for seed. The Title of the program was GROWING HYBRID CORN. Our second program was entitled THE AGRICULTURAL CONDITION OF SEVIER . COUNTY AND HOW THE VOCATION-AL AGRICULTURE AT PI BETA PHI PLAYS ITS PART. This program was given by four senior FFA boys. 14. Tennessee FFA Convention was attended THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 53 by five boys and myself in Memphis, Tennessee, April 25 and 26. Our chapter was presented with the camp award, mentioned as a third place winner of the Livestock Judging contest and also that Roy McCarter from II B (1) had made the highest number of points of any boy in the East Tennessee Livestock judging contest. Dot Fox, a junior, and also a Hybrid Corn Grower, was awarded the degree of the Tennessee State planter. Dot plans to try to become an American farmer within the next two years. The fifth district of FFA offered three money awards to the best supervised farming program conducted by a boy last year. Dot won the second prize and the first prize went to a University of Tennessee Freshman boy of the college of agriculture. THE SCHOOL FARM: This year we had eight boys in the Dormitory who did the work on the farm and janitor work in the school houses. Six of these boys took Vocational Agriculture. They were given charge of certain enterprises in which they were responsible in their work. This causes the boy to take more interest in his work and thus a better job is done. Last fall our Jerseys, poultry, hogs, and farm products placed well at our County Fair. We had the Grand Champion animal of the Jersey Show. This year we have 140 white Leghorn hens in our laying flock. 100 white Leghorn sexed baby chicks were bought for replacements in the laying flock next fall. 800 baby chicks were bought and fed to broiler weight for Dining hall and to sell to the hotel. Mountain View Hotel uses all of our extra broilers which we produce and gives us a good price for them. Two modern brooder houses were constructed on the farm by agriculture boys as a part of their training in Agriculture. A water line was laid from the Boys' Dormitory to the incubator house. This makes it possible for us to provide ample water for livestock at the barn without having to carry it. As to the financial standing of the farm I pre-sent the following: Month Sold to Farm Farm Kitchen Expense Receipts July $ 229.09 $ 6.95 $ 37.93 August 194.36 412.23 4.00 September 145.69 80.71 2.00 October 205.49 152.68 23.35 November 145.25 273.76 36.16 December 141.01 254.62 19.00 January 157.52 3.88 64.48 February 150.05 273.92 72.10 March 264.51 90.22 April 236.69 155.81 27.63 May 175.20 336.78 247.62 Total $2,044.86 $2,052.45 $534.27 Sold to kitchen plus cash income $2,579.13 Total income less expenses 526.68 ).

One of the Park men helped us with the landscaping. The little rustic bridge at the side has been moved up the creek a few feet so that the school children do not cross the corner there. With a few more additions on the interior it should be complete. Hardly a customer fails to exclaim over its beauty. Taking it month by month through the year business has been consistently better. The amount of returns remained about the same but they were sent back earlier in the year as a whole. One particular club so far out-distanced all the rest this year they should be mentioned in this report. Berkeley up to June 1 has sold $1,911.80 with the month of June to bring it up to two thousand. The next highest sales record was the New York Club with $970.94. Dallas was a close third. To spoil that picture there is over $5,800 out-standing on our books against clubs. This represents unsold goods or failure to send in money promptly. I am still in hopes the month of June will clear up a great deal of that as our books go SCHOOL URING these last weeks of school Mrs. Weaver has been sorely missed. Perhaps I can give you a brief outline of some of the things that have happened. The grade school was out the latter part of April and the following teachers have been elected for next school year. Mr. Pern Price of. Gatlinburg will remain as Principal. Pauline Sharp, Eleanor Brabson, and Veryl Elder will return from the County. Doris Hatch, Illinois A and Flora Belle De Witt, Colorado B, will also return to us in the Fall. Due to the marriage of Ruth Parker and the resignation of Pauline Morris there will be two new Pi Phis to take their places, Mary Hayward, Arizona A, and Sue Viering, Illinois A. Mr. King, who has been Superintendent for ten years, tendered his resignation. Mr. Fleming will take his place. Cleo Nelson, North Dakota A, has also resigned. Miriam Moore, Kansas B, will be to an auditor the first day of July. The Fall Guild meeting was just over the mountain at the Cherokee Indian Reservation in North Carolina. The spring meeting was in Knoxville as usual, followed by a meeting of Southern Highlanders Inc. at Norris in the afternoon. The Southeastern Arts Association was meeting in Knoxville at the same time. A great number of our things were in their display. Besides attending those three meetings I have visited the John C. Campbell Folk School this past year. The Guild Shop in Asheville has done so well through the years that it was decided to use part of the small surplus to start another shop in the Shenandoah National Park. Arrowcraft, as a member, will have that as another market. We have already had several re-orders but it is too early to know if they will be able to sell as much as Allan-stand has for us. In making out a recent report I find that one third is sold as cash sales to the passing tourists, one sixth wholesale to other shops through the country, and one half by our own alumnae clubs and active chapters. That is a grand record to have kept through the years. Respectfully submitted, ETHEL WEAVER SNOW the Pi Phi to take her place. The new County teacher on the High School staff is to be Margaret Burchfield of Sevierville. -She is graduating with high honors from the University of Tennessee and will go on to summer school to finish her Library training so that she may have charge of the School Library along with her other work. The County board allowed us enough money for one other high school teacher this coming year. It has to be some one who can teach chemistry and I am still hoping some outstanding Pi Phi will offer her services. There is also a position open to a Pi Phi who knows double entry bookkeeping. Mrs. Elizabeth Peck, California B, comes to us very soon as the new Director. The rest of the school staff remains the same. Their reports will speak for themselves. Respectfully submitted, ETHEL WEAVER SNOW \ i \ T EPO Convention, June 21-27, 1942, New Ocean House, Swampscott, Mass. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW WEAVING DEPA ow that the Arrowcraft fiscal year for 1941 is about to pass into history, we can say hat we have produced more weaving during this han in any previous year. We have had a total of 7 women weaving for us which is not our highest ecord but they have earned more during the year han any other group. This year in the eleven aonths ending May 1941 they have earned 12,636.35. In the same period a year ago they tad earned $10,114.27 or a gain of $2,522.08. In )ecember 1940 we reached an all-time high for ,ne month when we paid the weavers $3,196.68. 'he weavers have shown their same loyalty and ooperation throughout the year that they always D. The play "Store Britches," the most ambitious indertaking the Weaver's Guild has ever atempted, was a decided success. The two casts gave 7 performances during the summer tourist season. 'he play was enthusiastically received by those vho saw it. The proceeds of the final performance vere given to the Gatlinburg Public Library and hey also gave $25.00 to the. Red Cross. Five veavers have borrowed from the fund to get ;lasses, one to pipe water into her house, and one a pay for an x-ray of her husband's stomach. They are planning to give the play again as a wrist attraction during July and August with the lea in mind of making it an annual affair whose hief value would be to keep alive in an authentic lay a bit of the fast-disappearing type of mountain amily life. This year the play will be under the omplete direction of Mrs. Phillip Maxwell. The greatest and most serious development as ar as our weaving is concerned during the year 3 the effect that the application of the Fair Labor tandards Act may have. The Southern Highland landicraft Guild has been carrying on negotiaions with the U. S. Department of Labor since 1st March. As this will affect not only Arrowcraft ut all handicraft organizations of the country qually, the Directors of the Guild thought that here is strength in unity and that we would get urther with the negotiations to have the Guild aembers represented as a whole rather than inividually. It is on. this basis that Arrowcraft has been ,articipating. All reports and correspondence that ve sent to Washington have been submitted to 4iss Onken or Mrs. Hagee first for approval. At the request of the Guild last March, as they were anticipating the investigation from Washagton anyway, the Hearings /Branch of the U. S. )epartment of Labor sent one of their staff memers to the annual meeting of the Guild in Knox-file. She stayed in the region three weeks making TMENT 1940-41 an extensive study of the work and set-up of the important centers in which Guild members were located. She stayed four days in Gatlinburg and visited not only Arrowcraft but the other shops as well, as they would have to comply with the law if they are in Interstate Commerce. This would automatically eliminate the price competition with which we have always been faced locally. Because hand-loom weaving would be the most difficult handicraft to readjust, a committee representing the important weaving members of the Guild was appointed with myself as chairman, to make an exhaustive study of weaving that is done in the homes and paid by the piece. This study included not only the producing but the marketing of weaving. The committee met in Gatlinburg on April 18 with seven weaving centers represented. The report of their findings has not yet been sent to the Department of Labor as they are still working on some of the questions that were sent to them by the Department of Labor to be studied. At the present time nothing definite has been decided and the issue is still in the hands of the President of the Guild and the Department of Labor. The future selling prices of weaving are hard to predict with the uncertainty that is attached both to the advancing of the prices for materials and the probable application to handicrafts of the Wage and Hour Act. I have tried to safeguard as much as possible against the continuous advance in the price of materials by buying in quantity supplies of wool and linen before the rise took place. This is only a temporary advantage for as long as the war lasts, prices will continue to change. Wool has gone up recently and linen has already advanced over 100% with the supply uncertain. We have on hand enough staple linen to last us 8 to 12 more months and wool to last 6 to 8 months at our present rate of production with but few additional purchases. Cotton prices have not advanced materially as yet. This will necessarily mean increasing our selling prices on many of the woven articles and the cautious weaving of all our linens. It would help our weaving program tremendously this fall if the Clubs would not over-estimate the linens they will need for their sales and order on the hand-to-mouth plan. Everything that we do not have to weave will conserve our supply of materials that cannot be replaced at the prices we paid for them. I hesitate to overstock in face of the uncertain times ahead. Respectfully submitted, WINOGENE B. REDDING PRINCIPAL'S ANNUAL EPO T, 1940.41 1st' THE 1940-41 school year opened on Tuesday after Labor Day, with the brightest promise of very successful school year. The opening day's nrollment was the largest on record for the high chool, and both pupils and teachers seemed nxious to get down to work. The teaching staff was composed of: William wing, principal, History and Social Science; Ben qeming, Mathematics, Science, and Coach; Cleo Nelson, English and Librarian; William Coe, Vocational Agriculture; Charlotte Herman, Vocational Home Economics; and William Oakes, Vocational Handicrafts. Miss Nelson and Miss Herman, the new members of the staff, while lacking in experience, worked hard at the job and the high school ran along as smoothly as could be expected. The large enrollment made a longer school day THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 49 necessary as more classes had to be taught by the same teaching force. The school day was lengthened from six to eight periods, and the length of the periods changed from sixty to forty-five minutes. A new course in Biology was introduced for the sophomore class and Sociology was added for the seniors. The course of study this year consisted of: English, four units; Science, three units; History, and Social Science, four units; Mathematics, three units; Vocational Agriculture, three units; Vocational Home Economics, three units, and Handicrafts, one unit; a total of twenty-one classes daily. The high school enrollment showed a consider-able increase of the preceding year. This rate of increase will probably continue for two more years and then will level off, unless school busses are added to bring students from other communities.

They won thirteen games and lost JENNIE N][COL MEMO TWENTY years ago, the Jennie Nicol Memorial Health Center moved into the little white cottage that had been the home of the Andrew Ogle family. Through the years of service and friendly understanding, the few cases of the beginning years have grown to hundreds. Methods change as need arises, but the pioneers builded well, and the policies have changed but little. One of the most important phases of the work of the Health Center, is the care of the maternity cases. Twenty-six mothers were on the records for the year, most of whom were under the super-vision of some doctor. Advice on diet and exercise, lists and articles for layettes, preparation for home delivery or for hospitalization were given. Regular check of weight and general condition were kept as often as possible. Some of the new babies had regular nursing care for a few days, and some as well as older babies had formulas or diets regulated as necessary. Many of them have been in for the Friday after-noon clinics many times. One premature baby was fed with a medicine dropper for several days, until she was strong enough to nurse, and kept in a warmed basket in lieu of an incubator. One baby developed pneumonia, with supplementary infection, and lived but twenty-four hours, in spite of every treatment that could be suggested by the specialists in Knoxville. An oxygen tank was even borrowed from a service station and an inhalation mask devised from a paper sack, all to no avail. Henry, aged two and a half, and nearly blind from an attack of meningitis the year previous, one during the regular playing season, and went to the semi-finals in the district tournament. Four-teen players were awarded letters at the close of the season. The Settlement School staff put on the play "Who's Crazy Now" to a large and appreciative audience. The purpose of the play was to raise money for a moving picture machine for the school. The junior class presented a play in the fall and the senior class gave two plays to raise money for their trip to Washington. The trip of the senior class to the nation's capital, was one of the high lights of the school year for the seniors. They worked all year to make the necessary money for transportation. They had a five day trip, going to Washington by way of Natural Bridge and the Skyline Drive. They spent two days sightseeing in Washington and returned home by way of Yorktown, Norfolk, and Virginia Beach. The various clubs of the school had a very active year. The Home Economics club and the FFA furnished much of the social life of the school. The glee club under the direction of Mrs. Chalmers and Miss Nelson furnished the music for commencement. Dr. Stewart W. McClelland, President of , Lincoln Memorial University, delivered the commencement address, and Rev. W. D. Wilkinson preached the Baccalaureate sermon. Twenty seniors received their diplomas. Respectfully submitted, WILLIAM KING, Principal IAL HEALTH CENTE had an eye examination by Dr. Robert Leech of Knoxville. The child seems to do little more than distinguish light from darkness, and there seems little hope of any improvement. Probably at some later date, he may be placed in some school for some sort of training. Little red-headed Marjorie, whose left foot was straightened by Dr. Bagwell, is walking freely. Six months old Margaret has both tiny legs in casts for club foot correction. She is a patient of the Crippled Children's Clinic, and reports there on alternate Fridays for observation, change of cast or treatment. The Crippled Children's work is done under the auspices of the Sevier County Post of the American Legion, and by state funds. School inspections were held at intervals during the year at Gatlinburg, and at the six rural schools. Inoculations for typhoid, diphtheria, and small pox were made as necessary in each place. Talks pertaining to health were ,made in class rooms and in other meetings. The general health of the school children seems to be improving year by year. Fewer are underweight, due to supervised lunches, and increased knowledge of both parents and children. The Sevierville Lions Club has bought glasses for several children of the district, and r sorority aids in the correction of defects. A number of children had tonsils removed, a few had appendectomies, and many visited the dentist. There were innumerable dressings, a few fractures, and many sprains. But the high light of the school health program is the lessening of the old enemy, impetigo. Better living conditions, more balanced 10 \ 50 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW diet, and persistence of treatment, are undoubtedly responsible. Community nursing consists mostly of emergency or special treatment. Post-operative dressings, massage, hypodermics, irrigations, and instruction in home nursing. Several were taken to Cancer or Tuberculosis Clinics, and for X-rays. Three doctors in Sevierville have infirmaries, and rapid ambulance service has made it possible to transport patients quickly and safely. The Loan Closet continues to be of great service. Crutches, rubber sheeting, bed pans, hot water bottles, and ice caps are borrowed in case of need, and returned for the use of others. Night clothing for children and adults, and baby things are used again and again. As always, we are grateful for the cooperation met on every side, from the doctors who so freely give advice and aid, the members of the staff, and of the Fraternity. Above all, we are grateful for the friendship and appreciation of the people of the community. The work of the Health Center seems to go beyond mere physical needs. Worry and unhappiness are as tangible as disease, and a tonic for the ELEMENTA THE Ij[ B (1, Elementary School opened on September 3, 1940 with the following teachers: Eleanor Brabson, primer; Doris Hatch, first grade; Ruth Parker, second grade; Veryle Elder, third grade; Pauline Morris, fourth grade; Pauline Sharp, fifth grade; Flora Belle DeWitt, sixth and seventh grades ; C. Pern Price, eighth grade. For the seventh consecutive year the II B Elementary School has won the cup in the Blue Ribbon contest for the larger schools. This is quite a distinction as no other school in the county, large or small, can equal this record. For the second year the elementary school has been given a rating of 100% in the sanitation program. We are one of the twelve schools in the county to make this record. A number of books for our library were given to us by friends from Muncie, Indiana. Most all system no more necessary than a tonic for morale. It is our sincere hope that the Health Center may continue to stand for those things, whatever they may be, that will make life happier and more healthful for our people.

MARJORIE CHALMERS, R.N. Y SCHOOL the books were fiction. On April 8, 1941, the faculty of the high school and elementary school gave a play, "Who's Crazy Now." In addition to the faculty Mrs. Snow and Miss Redding took part. The purpose of this play was to take the proceeds and apply on a 16 mm. motion picture machine for use of the school. The enrollment for 1940-41 was 285. The average daily attendance was 225. Inattendance, "flu" and other reasons kept this lower than it should have been. The elementary school had its first football team. Out of five games played they did not lose a game and had their goal line crossed only twice during the season. The largest eighth grade class to finish school in the elementary department finished this year. C. PERN PRICE HANDICRAFTS FoR my report I am giving you an exact list of the articles that were made by the high school group for the past year. There were fourteen in this group that finished this year. Five were seniors and nine juniors. There were five of this group who took other classes during this class period. Some few of them came in the afternoons to make some of this time up. I never had the entire group in the shop at the same time. I could not give the organized work that I should have given, because of this. There were some few that be-came quite skilled. If they could go on with this work, they could accomplish something. As it is they can't take another year because they have had two vocational credits and can have only four to graduate. This course gives two. All of the equipment is in first class order. There have been only a few tools lost. A handsaw, hammer, and a pair of side cutting pliers disappeared while the plumbers were here. Every member of the group this year made an article for the school, to be left here. Many thanks for the job and the many favors, Sincerely, WILLIAM O. OAKES HOME ECONOMICS DEPARTMENT ORTY-SEVEN girls were enrolled in Home five were freshmen, ten were sophomores, and FEconomks the largest number in the history twelve were juniors. The seniors were unable to of the Settlement School. Of this group, twentytake Home Economics as an elective because it THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 51 conflicted with their required courses. In the freshman class, the most popular units were those in clothing construction. The girls made simple blouses, skirts, and aprons in the fall to learn how to use the sewing machine and how to follow a commercial pattern. Some of the girls had sewed considerably at home so each girl chose a clothing problem according to her own skill level so that she could learn something new in her class project. At the end of the six weeks' unit in sewing, the class judged the dresses, and on this basis, two achievement awards were made. The awards were pins given by a commercial pattern company. The girls were very proud of their prizes. During the first semester, we also studied personal grooming, etiquette, and breakfast preparation and service. In October, the freshmen gave an afternoon tea for their mothers and the school staff. This was the climax of their study of manners, introductions, and the art of being a hostess. During the foods units the girls were divided into families for the purpose of working together in planning and preparing the food. Each family served a breakfast in early December, inviting one of the elementary school teachers as guest. In the second semester the freshmen studied child care and development, using their own brothers and sisters at home for observation; preparation and serving of luncheons; school lunches; and food for outdoor hikes and picnics. The sophomore class seemed to be most interested in the foods units. In our first unit food preservation, we canned tomatoes, and apple sauce, and made orange marmalade and apple jelly. As a result of this study, two of the girls made jelly for home projects. Awards similar to those the freshmen received were given the sophomores on the completion of their fall wool dresses. The weaving for the sophomores worked out very well this year because there was an even number of girls in the class so that each pair could work on one loom. Three of our six weeks were spent in making the warps and in setting up the looms for weaving. Each girl then wove a sampler, a towel, and a pillow top. While half the girls were weaving, the others were sewing on baby garments for the American Red Cross. Other units that the sophomores studied included: elements of nutrition, personal grooming, and luncheon preparation and service. 0 MITO THE year of 1940-41 has been a very busy one. As in any household, looking back, it is hard to say what has been accomplished. The culinary department has been taken care of by Belle Lowe and Mrs. Lurie Hurst, and the necessary upkeep such as mending, new curtains, helping the boys and girls, has fallen to me. Two of our girls left us in April to ride the bus to school, but I replaced them by another. The juniors were especially interested in individual development, so our year's work was planned along that line. The first semester they studied personality improvement, personal grooming, clothing budgets and wardrobes, and clothing construction. Two of the girls made wool suits, several made afternoon dresses, and the others made wool school dresses. One week was spent in the, study of vocations for girls. Nursing, office work, and elementary school teaching were especially interesting to the class. The second semester the juniors took up special party cookery, food and health, textiles, clothing construction, and outdoor cookery. At Christmas time, the sophomores planned the menu, decorated, and served the annual dinner for the faculty. The juniors were in charge of food preparation. This spring the juniors planned and prepared the food for the F.F.A. boys and their parents, and the freshmen and sophomores decorated and served. Ninety guests were served in the general science laboratory. Four girls went to the Open House at the University of Tennessee. One junior modelled a two-piece wool dress and a sophomore modelled a spring skirt and jerkin. In March, the juniors took a field trip to Knoxville to visit the furniture stores, after studying about the different types of furnishings suitable for their own homes. Each girl completed three home projects, in addition to her class work. Sewing seemed to be the most popular type of project. Among the projects were: quilts, baby and children's clothes, curtains, pillow cases, slip covers for chairs, and all types of clothes for the girls themselves. Some of the food projects were: baking; preparation of breakfasts, luncheons, and suppers; and a study of pastries. The Home Economics Club had fifty-five members this year. Bi-weekly meetings were held, with programs planned by the girls at each meeting. From November through March, the Home Economics teacher and the Agriculture teacher con-ducted a joint class for adult men and women at the Laurel Grove School in Wear's Valley. The classes met an hour and a half every two weeks. Among the topics discussed for women were: home gardens, menu planning, food and health, and canning. Respectfully submitted, CHARLOTTE HERMAN MS, 1940-41 I have bought five unfinished dressers for th, girls' dormitory and finished them, and had tit floor in the dining room sanded and waxed, an( with Mrs. Hagee's assistance bought a linoleun rug for "Miss Georgic's" room. I would recommend that the kitchen be painted and if it is possible that an electric mixer b purchased for the kitchen. Respectfully submitted, ANNETTE MORSE 5 2 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE ALL DAY CLASSES: This year's enrollment in this group reached a total of fifty-one boys. Three classes were taught in Vocational Agriculture. These classes consisted of twenty-five freshman boys, another class was made up of seventeen sophomores and still another consisted of eight iunior and senior boys. This year we had thirty-four of the fifty-one beginning boys to complete the entire school year. The remaining thirty-foul boys are at present conducting complete supervised Farming Programs. EVENING SCHOOL CLASSES: One night school was conducted in the Laurel Grove Community for those men who are established in the business of farming. This adult class I teach at least one night out of each month and this continues throughout the year. This year we had seventeen meetings with a total of fifty-three farmers enrolled. Our course of study is based on the needs of the community. We made surveys to determine what were the farming and living conditions of the Laurel Grove Community. After spending one class meeting in a discussion of our data, the farmers came to the conclusion that their greatest problem was low income. Farmers were then led to set up objectives which would increase their farm income. They were: 1. To increase soil fertility through (a) liming (b) phosphating (c) rotating crops (d) growing winter cover crops 2. To provide livestock of good type to consume all feed produced on the farm. 3. To produce the home food supply on the farm as nearly as possible. 4. To improve the farm home and its surroundings through (a) providing electric lights and running water in the home. (b) repairing the farm home. (c) improving the home grounds. PART-TIME CLASSES: This year one class was taught to a group of out-of-school boys at Camp Morgan, the CCC camp which is located five miles away from the school. I met with this group of thirty-two boys one night each week to study problems pertaining to farming. These boys as a group have three projects on the camp grounds: 1. Poultry 2. Bees 3. Rabbits On January 1 of this year, there came aid through the Sevier County Board of Education to provide National Defense Training for out-ofschool rural and urban youth. The supervision of these .classes became the job of the Vocational Agriculture Teachers throughout the State. Our School provided two of these classes to this group. One of these was taught by Mr. Walter Cardwell in woodworking, in which twenty-five boys were enrolled. The other class is now being taught at Pigeon Forge Elementary School House by Mr. Fred Cooper. This course is in elementary electricity, in which twenty students are enrolled. It is hoped that these boys will be better able to do the necessary jobs in preparation for war or in time of war. We have an improved Farm Shop as a result of this training. We now have $264.00 worth of additional equipment for our farm shop. We think this equipment will become the property of Sevier County Board of Education and this will be left with the Agricultural Department of our School. THE FFA CHAPTER: The Future Farmers of America chapter has completed a most successful year. We have taken part in the following outside activities of the School: 1. Showing Dairy Cattle at the County Fair. 2. Exhibiting Farm products, farmshop work, and poultry at the County Fair and at the Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial Fair at Knoxville. 3. Sponsored FFA and Home Economics socials. 4. Livestock and Dairy cattle judging contest at the University of Tennessee in which sixty-eight high school chapters of FFA competed. (Pi Phi won third place in Livestock and Roy McCarter, a senior FFA boy, was high point contestant of the whole contest in which 209 boys entered.) 5. Sponsored Third Annual Parent and Son Banquet. (FFA boys invited their mothers and fathers. Eighty-seven parents and guests attended.) 6. Public Speaking contest at University. (Roy Ogle, a senior FFA boy, placed second in the 5th district which had 14 chapters competing.) 7. FFA Baseball and Basketball teams. 8. Presentation of the FFA cup to best All-around high school girl. 9. Two boys continue to produce Hybrid corn for seed. Last year one boy sold $224.00 worth of seed corn harvested from one acre. 10. Four town boys who are taking agriculture have rented land from the airport and have what appears to be successful Home Gar-dens. Some of these boys have in addition, Home Improvement, and twenty-five to fifty chicks for broilers. 11. CAMP CLEMENTS Five boys and I at-tended the Tennessee FFA camp for one week last summer. (Pi Phi won the athletic award for that week's activities.) 12. FFA field day, the last Saturday in April, found us competing in field meets at Powell Station High School, Knox County, with FFA chapters of the 5th district. The boys did well in the events, but their total points were not enough to surpass the Powell Station FFA. 13. RADIO PROGRAMS. This year the Pi Beta Phi FFA sponsored two programs over WNOX. The first program was presented by four boys who were growing Hybrid corn for seed. The Title of the program was GROWING HYBRID CORN. Our second program was entitled THE AGRICULTURAL CONDITION OF SEVIER . COUNTY AND HOW THE VOCATION-AL AGRICULTURE AT PI BETA PHI PLAYS ITS PART. This program was given by four senior FFA boys. 14. Tennessee FFA Convention was attended THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 53 by five boys and myself in Memphis, Tennessee, April 25 and 26. Our chapter was presented with the camp award, mentioned as a third place winner of the Livestock Judging contest and also that Roy McCarter from II B (1) had made the highest number of points of any boy in the East Tennessee Livestock judging contest. Dot Fox, a junior, and also a Hybrid Corn Grower, was awarded the degree of the Tennessee State planter. Dot plans to try to become an American farmer within the next two years. The fifth district of FFA offered three money awards to the best supervised farming program conducted by a boy last year. Dot won the second prize and the first prize went to a University of Tennessee Freshman boy of the college of agriculture. THE SCHOOL FARM: This year we had eight boys in the Dormitory who did the work on the farm and janitor work in the school houses. Six of these boys took Vocational Agriculture. They were given charge of certain enterprises in which they were responsible in their work. This causes the boy to take more interest in his work and thus a better job is done. Last fall our Jerseys, poultry, hogs, and farm products placed well at our County Fair. We had the Grand Champion animal of the Jersey Show. This year we have 140 white Leghorn hens in our laying flock. 100 white Leghorn sexed baby chicks were bought for replacements in the laying flock next fall. 800 baby chicks were bought and fed to broiler weight for Dining hall and to sell to the hotel. Mountain View Hotel uses all of our extra broilers which we produce and gives us a good price for them. Two modern brooder houses were constructed on the farm by agriculture boys as a part of their training in Agriculture. A water line was laid from the Boys' Dormitory to the incubator house. This makes it possible for us to provide ample water for livestock at the barn without having to carry it. As to the financial standing of the farm I pre-sent the following: Month Sold to Farm Farm Kitchen Expense Receipts July $ 229.09 $ 6.95 $ 37.93 August 194.36 412.23 4.00 September 145.69 80.71 2.00 October 205.49 152.68 23.35 November 145.25 273.76 36.16 December 141.01 254.62 19.00 January 157.52 3.88 64.48 February 150.05 273.92 72.10 March 264.51 90.22 April 236.69 155.81 27.63 May 175.20 336.78 247.62 Total $2,044.86 $2,052.45 $534.27 Sold to kitchen plus cash income $2,579.13 Total income less expenses 526.68 ).

The driveway has been changed to the side of the house with parking space toward the rear. This gives a solid expanse of lawn in front. Native shrubs surround it. One of the Park men helped us with the landscaping. The little rustic bridge at the side has been moved up the creek a few feet so that the school children do not cross the corner there. With a few more additions on the interior it should be complete. Hardly a customer fails to exclaim over its beauty. Taking it month by month through the year business has been consistently better. The amount of returns remained about the same but they were sent back earlier in the year as a whole. One particular club so far out-distanced all the rest this year they should be mentioned in this report. Berkeley up to June 1 has sold $1,911.80 with the month of June to bring it up to two thousand. The next highest sales record was the New York Club with $970.94. Dallas was a close third. To spoil that picture there is over $5,800 out-standing on our books against clubs. This represents unsold goods or failure to send in money promptly. I am still in hopes the month of June will clear up a great deal of that as our books go SCHOOL URING these last weeks of school Mrs. Weaver has been sorely missed. Perhaps I can give you a brief outline of some of the things that have happened. The grade school was out the latter part of April and the following teachers have been elected for next school year. Mr. Pern Price of. Gatlinburg will remain as Principal. Pauline Sharp, Eleanor Brabson, and Veryl Elder will return from the County. Doris Hatch, Illinois A and Flora Belle De Witt, Colorado B, will also return to us in the Fall. Due to the marriage of Ruth Parker and the resignation of Pauline Morris there will be two new Pi Phis to take their places, Mary Hayward, Arizona A, and Sue Viering, Illinois A. Mr. King, who has been Superintendent for ten years, tendered his resignation. Mr. Fleming will take his place. Cleo Nelson, North Dakota A, has also resigned. Miriam Moore, Kansas B, will be to an auditor the first day of July. The Fall Guild meeting was just over the mountain at the Cherokee Indian Reservation in North Carolina. The spring meeting was in Knoxville as usual, followed by a meeting of Southern Highlanders Inc. at Norris in the afternoon. The Southeastern Arts Association was meeting in Knoxville at the same time. A great number of our things were in their display. Besides attending those three meetings I have visited the John C. Campbell Folk School this past year. The Guild Shop in Asheville has done so well through the years that it was decided to use part of the small surplus to start another shop in the Shenandoah National Park. Arrowcraft, as a member, will have that as another market. We have already had several re-orders but it is too early to know if they will be able to sell as much as Allan-stand has for us. In making out a recent report I find that one third is sold as cash sales to the passing tourists, one sixth wholesale to other shops through the country, and one half by our own alumnae clubs and active chapters. That is a grand record to have kept through the years. Respectfully submitted, ETHEL WEAVER SNOW the Pi Phi to take her place. The new County teacher on the High School staff is to be Margaret Burchfield of Sevierville. -She is graduating with high honors from the University of Tennessee and will go on to summer school to finish her Library training so that she may have charge of the School Library along with her other work. The County board allowed us enough money for one other high school teacher this coming year. It has to be some one who can teach chemistry and I am still hoping some outstanding Pi Phi will offer her services. There is also a position open to a Pi Phi who knows double entry bookkeeping. Mrs. Elizabeth Peck, California B, comes to us very soon as the new Director. The rest of the school staff remains the same. Their reports will speak for themselves. Respectfully submitted, ETHEL WEAVER SNOW \ i \ T EPO Convention, June 21-27, 1942, New Ocean House, Swampscott, Mass. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW WEAVING DEPA ow that the Arrowcraft fiscal year for 1941 is about to pass into history, we can say hat we have produced more weaving during this han in any previous year. We have had a total of 7 women weaving for us which is not our highest ecord but they have earned more during the year han any other group. This year in the eleven aonths ending May 1941 they have earned 12,636.35. In the same period a year ago they tad earned $10,114.27 or a gain of $2,522.08. In )ecember 1940 we reached an all-time high for ,ne month when we paid the weavers $3,196.68. 'he weavers have shown their same loyalty and ooperation throughout the year that they always D. The play "Store Britches," the most ambitious indertaking the Weaver's Guild has ever atempted, was a decided success. The two casts gave 7 performances during the summer tourist season. 'he play was enthusiastically received by those vho saw it. The proceeds of the final performance vere given to the Gatlinburg Public Library and hey also gave $25.00 to the. Red Cross. Five veavers have borrowed from the fund to get ;lasses, one to pipe water into her house, and one a pay for an x-ray of her husband's stomach. They are planning to give the play again as a wrist attraction during July and August with the lea in mind of making it an annual affair whose hief value would be to keep alive in an authentic lay a bit of the fast-disappearing type of mountain amily life. This year the play will be under the omplete direction of Mrs. Phillip Maxwell. The greatest and most serious development as ar as our weaving is concerned during the year 3 the effect that the application of the Fair Labor tandards Act may have. The Southern Highland landicraft Guild has been carrying on negotiaions with the U. S. Department of Labor since 1st March. As this will affect not only Arrowcraft ut all handicraft organizations of the country qually, the Directors of the Guild thought that here is strength in unity and that we would get urther with the negotiations to have the Guild aembers represented as a whole rather than inividually. It is on. this basis that Arrowcraft has been ,articipating. All reports and correspondence that ve sent to Washington have been submitted to 4iss Onken or Mrs. Hagee first for approval. At the request of the Guild last March, as they were anticipating the investigation from Washagton anyway, the Hearings /Branch of the U. S. )epartment of Labor sent one of their staff memers to the annual meeting of the Guild in Knox-file. She stayed in the region three weeks making TMENT 1940-41 an extensive study of the work and set-up of the important centers in which Guild members were located. She stayed four days in Gatlinburg and visited not only Arrowcraft but the other shops as well, as they would have to comply with the law if they are in Interstate Commerce. This would automatically eliminate the price competition with which we have always been faced locally. Because hand-loom weaving would be the most difficult handicraft to readjust, a committee representing the important weaving members of the Guild was appointed with myself as chairman, to make an exhaustive study of weaving that is done in the homes and paid by the piece. This study included not only the producing but the marketing of weaving. The committee met in Gatlinburg on April 18 with seven weaving centers represented. The report of their findings has not yet been sent to the Department of Labor as they are still working on some of the questions that were sent to them by the Department of Labor to be studied. At the present time nothing definite has been decided and the issue is still in the hands of the President of the Guild and the Department of Labor. The future selling prices of weaving are hard to predict with the uncertainty that is attached both to the advancing of the prices for materials and the probable application to handicrafts of the Wage and Hour Act. I have tried to safeguard as much as possible against the continuous advance in the price of materials by buying in quantity supplies of wool and linen before the rise took place. This is only a temporary advantage for as long as the war lasts, prices will continue to change. Wool has gone up recently and linen has already advanced over 100% with the supply uncertain. We have on hand enough staple linen to last us 8 to 12 more months and wool to last 6 to 8 months at our present rate of production with but few additional purchases. Cotton prices have not advanced materially as yet. This will necessarily mean increasing our selling prices on many of the woven articles and the cautious weaving of all our linens. It would help our weaving program tremendously this fall if the Clubs would not over-estimate the linens they will need for their sales and order on the hand-to-mouth plan. Everything that we do not have to weave will conserve our supply of materials that cannot be replaced at the prices we paid for them. I hesitate to overstock in face of the uncertain times ahead. Respectfully submitted, WINOGENE B. REDDING PRINCIPAL'S ANNUAL EPO T, 1940.41 1st' THE 1940-41 school year opened on Tuesday after Labor Day, with the brightest promise of very successful school year. The opening day's nrollment was the largest on record for the high chool, and both pupils and teachers seemed nxious to get down to work. The teaching staff was composed of: William wing, principal, History and Social Science; Ben qeming, Mathematics, Science, and Coach; Cleo Nelson, English and Librarian; William Coe, Vocational Agriculture; Charlotte Herman, Vocational Home Economics; and William Oakes, Vocational Handicrafts. Miss Nelson and Miss Herman, the new members of the staff, while lacking in experience, worked hard at the job and the high school ran along as smoothly as could be expected. The large enrollment made a longer school day THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 49 necessary as more classes had to be taught by the same teaching force. The school day was lengthened from six to eight periods, and the length of the periods changed from sixty to forty-five minutes. A new course in Biology was introduced for the sophomore class and Sociology was added for the seniors. The course of study this year consisted of: English, four units; Science, three units; History, and Social Science, four units; Mathematics, three units; Vocational Agriculture, three units; Vocational Home Economics, three units, and Handicrafts, one unit; a total of twenty-one classes daily. The high school enrollment showed a consider-able increase of the preceding year. This rate of increase will probably continue for two more years and then will level off, unless school busses are added to bring students from other communities.

They won thirteen games and lost JENNIE N][COL MEMO TWENTY years ago, the Jennie Nicol Memorial Health Center moved into the little white cottage that had been the home of the Andrew Ogle family. Through the years of service and friendly understanding, the few cases of the beginning years have grown to hundreds. Methods change as need arises, but the pioneers builded well, and the policies have changed but little. One of the most important phases of the work of the Health Center, is the care of the maternity cases. Twenty-six mothers were on the records for the year, most of whom were under the super-vision of some doctor. Advice on diet and exercise, lists and articles for layettes, preparation for home delivery or for hospitalization were given. Regular check of weight and general condition were kept as often as possible. Some of the new babies had regular nursing care for a few days, and some as well as older babies had formulas or diets regulated as necessary. Many of them have been in for the Friday after-noon clinics many times. One premature baby was fed with a medicine dropper for several days, until she was strong enough to nurse, and kept in a warmed basket in lieu of an incubator. One baby developed pneumonia, with supplementary infection, and lived but twenty-four hours, in spite of every treatment that could be suggested by the specialists in Knoxville. An oxygen tank was even borrowed from a service station and an inhalation mask devised from a paper sack, all to no avail. Henry, aged two and a half, and nearly blind from an attack of meningitis the year previous, one during the regular playing season, and went to the semi-finals in the district tournament. Four-teen players were awarded letters at the close of the season. The Settlement School staff put on the play "Who's Crazy Now" to a large and appreciative audience. The purpose of the play was to raise money for a moving picture machine for the school. The junior class presented a play in the fall and the senior class gave two plays to raise money for their trip to Washington. The trip of the senior class to the nation's capital, was one of the high lights of the school year for the seniors. They worked all year to make the necessary money for transportation. They had a five day trip, going to Washington by way of Natural Bridge and the Skyline Drive. They spent two days sightseeing in Washington and returned home by way of Yorktown, Norfolk, and Virginia Beach. The various clubs of the school had a very active year. The Home Economics club and the FFA furnished much of the social life of the school. The glee club under the direction of Mrs. Chalmers and Miss Nelson furnished the music for commencement. Dr. Stewart W. McClelland, President of , Lincoln Memorial University, delivered the commencement address, and Rev. W. D. Wilkinson preached the Baccalaureate sermon. Twenty seniors received their diplomas. Respectfully submitted, WILLIAM KING, Principal IAL HEALTH CENTE had an eye examination by Dr. Robert Leech of Knoxville. The child seems to do little more than distinguish light from darkness, and there seems little hope of any improvement. Probably at some later date, he may be placed in some school for some sort of training. Little red-headed Marjorie, whose left foot was straightened by Dr. Bagwell, is walking freely. Six months old Margaret has both tiny legs in casts for club foot correction. She is a patient of the Crippled Children's Clinic, and reports there on alternate Fridays for observation, change of cast or treatment. The Crippled Children's work is done under the auspices of the Sevier County Post of the American Legion, and by state funds. School inspections were held at intervals during the year at Gatlinburg, and at the six rural schools. Inoculations for typhoid, diphtheria, and small pox were made as necessary in each place. Talks pertaining to health were ,made in class rooms and in other meetings. The general health of the school children seems to be improving year by year. Fewer are underweight, due to supervised lunches, and increased knowledge of both parents and children. The Sevierville Lions Club has bought glasses for several children of the district, and r sorority aids in the correction of defects. A number of children had tonsils removed, a few had appendectomies, and many visited the dentist. There were innumerable dressings, a few fractures, and many sprains. But the high light of the school health program is the lessening of the old enemy, impetigo. Better living conditions, more balanced 10 \ 50 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW diet, and persistence of treatment, are undoubtedly responsible. Community nursing consists mostly of emergency or special treatment. Post-operative dressings, massage, hypodermics, irrigations, and instruction in home nursing. Several were taken to Cancer or Tuberculosis Clinics, and for X-rays. Three doctors in Sevierville have infirmaries, and rapid ambulance service has made it possible to transport patients quickly and safely. The Loan Closet continues to be of great service. Crutches, rubber sheeting, bed pans, hot water bottles, and ice caps are borrowed in case of need, and returned for the use of others. Night clothing for children and adults, and baby things are used again and again. As always, we are grateful for the cooperation met on every side, from the doctors who so freely give advice and aid, the members of the staff, and of the Fraternity. Above all, we are grateful for the friendship and appreciation of the people of the community. The work of the Health Center seems to go beyond mere physical needs. Worry and unhappiness are as tangible as disease, and a tonic for the ELEMENTA THE Ij[ B (1, Elementary School opened on September 3, 1940 with the following teachers: Eleanor Brabson, primer; Doris Hatch, first grade; Ruth Parker, second grade; Veryle Elder, third grade; Pauline Morris, fourth grade; Pauline Sharp, fifth grade; Flora Belle DeWitt, sixth and seventh grades ; C. Pern Price, eighth grade. For the seventh consecutive year the II B Elementary School has won the cup in the Blue Ribbon contest for the larger schools. This is quite a distinction as no other school in the county, large or small, can equal this record. For the second year the elementary school has been given a rating of 100% in the sanitation program. We are one of the twelve schools in the county to make this record. A number of books for our library were given to us by friends from Muncie, Indiana. Most all system no more necessary than a tonic for morale. It is our sincere hope that the Health Center may continue to stand for those things, whatever they may be, that will make life happier and more healthful for our people. Following is the summary of the work of the past year, in comparison with that of the pre ceding period. 1939 40 Class of Work 1940 41 Field visits 2,187 1,922 Office calls 2,283 2,349 Surgical dressings 2,002 2,106 Pupil inspections 2,165 2,140 Health talks 69 78 Diphtheria immunization 53 67 Schick tests 49 78 Small pox vacccinations 125 170 *Total typhoid shots 442 1,261 Completed typhoid series 269 400 Other inoculations 163 302 * New state ruling makes it possible to give but one Typhoid inoculation on alternate years after the initial series of three. MARJORIE CHALMERS, R.N. Y SCHOOL the books were fiction. On April 8, 1941, the faculty of the high school and elementary school gave a play, "Who's Crazy Now." In addition to the faculty Mrs. Snow and Miss Redding took part. The purpose of this play was to take the proceeds and apply on a 16 mm. motion picture machine for use of the school. The enrollment for 1940-41 was 285. The average daily attendance was 225. Inattendance, "flu" and other reasons kept this lower than it should have been. The elementary school had its first football team. Out of five games played they did not lose a game and had their goal line crossed only twice during the season. The largest eighth grade class to finish school in the elementary department finished this year. C. PERN PRICE HANDICRAFTS FoR my report I am giving you an exact list of the articles that were made by the high school group for the past year. There were fourteen in this group that finished this year. Five were seniors and nine juniors. There were five of this group who took other classes during this class period. Some few of them came in the afternoons to make some of this time up. I never had the entire group in the shop at the same time. I could not give the organized work that I should have given, because of this. There were some few that be-came quite skilled. If they could go on with this work, they could accomplish something. As it is they can't take another year because they have had two vocational credits and can have only four to graduate. This course gives two. All of the equipment is in first class order. There have been only a few tools lost. A handsaw, hammer, and a pair of side cutting pliers disappeared while the plumbers were here. Every member of the group this year made an article for the school, to be left here. Many thanks for the job and the many favors, Sincerely, WILLIAM O. OAKES HOME ECONOMICS DEPARTMENT ORTY-SEVEN girls were enrolled in Home five were freshmen, ten were sophomores, and FEconomks the largest number in the history twelve were juniors. The seniors were unable to of the Settlement School. Of this group, twentytake Home Economics as an elective because it THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 51 conflicted with their required courses. In the freshman class, the most popular units were those in clothing construction. The girls made simple blouses, skirts, and aprons in the fall to learn how to use the sewing machine and how to follow a commercial pattern. Some of the girls had sewed considerably at home so each girl chose a clothing problem according to her own skill level so that she could learn something new in her class project. At the end of the six weeks' unit in sewing, the class judged the dresses, and on this basis, two achievement awards were made. The awards were pins given by a commercial pattern company. The girls were very proud of their prizes. During the first semester, we also studied personal grooming, etiquette, and breakfast preparation and service. In October, the freshmen gave an afternoon tea for their mothers and the school staff. This was the climax of their study of manners, introductions, and the art of being a hostess. During the foods units the girls were divided into families for the purpose of working together in planning and preparing the food. Each family served a breakfast in early December, inviting one of the elementary school teachers as guest. In the second semester the freshmen studied child care and development, using their own brothers and sisters at home for observation; preparation and serving of luncheons; school lunches; and food for outdoor hikes and picnics. The sophomore class seemed to be most interested in the foods units. In our first unit food preservation, we canned tomatoes, and apple sauce, and made orange marmalade and apple jelly. As a result of this study, two of the girls made jelly for home projects. Awards similar to those the freshmen received were given the sophomores on the completion of their fall wool dresses. The weaving for the sophomores worked out very well this year because there was an even number of girls in the class so that each pair could work on one loom. Three of our six weeks were spent in making the warps and in setting up the looms for weaving. Each girl then wove a sampler, a towel, and a pillow top. While half the girls were weaving, the others were sewing on baby garments for the American Red Cross. Other units that the sophomores studied included: elements of nutrition, personal grooming, and luncheon preparation and service. 0 MITO THE year of 1940-41 has been a very busy one. As in any household, looking back, it is hard to say what has been accomplished. The culinary department has been taken care of by Belle Lowe and Mrs. Lurie Hurst, and the necessary upkeep such as mending, new curtains, helping the boys and girls, has fallen to me. Two of our girls left us in April to ride the bus to school, but I replaced them by another. The juniors were especially interested in individual development, so our year's work was planned along that line. The first semester they studied personality improvement, personal grooming, clothing budgets and wardrobes, and clothing construction. Two of the girls made wool suits, several made afternoon dresses, and the others made wool school dresses. One week was spent in the, study of vocations for girls. Nursing, office work, and elementary school teaching were especially interesting to the class. The second semester the juniors took up special party cookery, food and health, textiles, clothing construction, and outdoor cookery. At Christmas time, the sophomores planned the menu, decorated, and served the annual dinner for the faculty. The juniors were in charge of food preparation. This spring the juniors planned and prepared the food for the F.F.A. boys and their parents, and the freshmen and sophomores decorated and served. Ninety guests were served in the general science laboratory. Four girls went to the Open House at the University of Tennessee. One junior modelled a two-piece wool dress and a sophomore modelled a spring skirt and jerkin. In March, the juniors took a field trip to Knoxville to visit the furniture stores, after studying about the different types of furnishings suitable for their own homes. Each girl completed three home projects, in addition to her class work. Sewing seemed to be the most popular type of project. Among the projects were: quilts, baby and children's clothes, curtains, pillow cases, slip covers for chairs, and all types of clothes for the girls themselves. Some of the food projects were: baking; preparation of breakfasts, luncheons, and suppers; and a study of pastries. The Home Economics Club had fifty-five members this year. Bi-weekly meetings were held, with programs planned by the girls at each meeting. From November through March, the Home Economics teacher and the Agriculture teacher con-ducted a joint class for adult men and women at the Laurel Grove School in Wear's Valley. The classes met an hour and a half every two weeks. Among the topics discussed for women were: home gardens, menu planning, food and health, and canning. Respectfully submitted, CHARLOTTE HERMAN MS, 1940-41 I have bought five unfinished dressers for th, girls' dormitory and finished them, and had tit floor in the dining room sanded and waxed, an( with Mrs. Hagee's assistance bought a linoleun rug for "Miss Georgic's" room. I would recommend that the kitchen be painted and if it is possible that an electric mixer b purchased for the kitchen. Respectfully submitted, ANNETTE MORSE 5 2 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE ALL DAY CLASSES: This year's enrollment in this group reached a total of fifty-one boys. Three classes were taught in Vocational Agriculture. These classes consisted of twenty-five freshman boys, another class was made up of seventeen sophomores and still another consisted of eight iunior and senior boys. This year we had thirty-four of the fifty-one beginning boys to complete the entire school year. The remaining thirty-foul boys are at present conducting complete supervised Farming Programs. EVENING SCHOOL CLASSES: One night school was conducted in the Laurel Grove Community for those men who are established in the business of farming. This adult class I teach at least one night out of each month and this continues throughout the year. This year we had seventeen meetings with a total of fifty-three farmers enrolled. Our course of study is based on the needs of the community. We made surveys to determine what were the farming and living conditions of the Laurel Grove Community. After spending one class meeting in a discussion of our data, the farmers came to the conclusion that their greatest problem was low income. Farmers were then led to set up objectives which would increase their farm income. They were: 1. To increase soil fertility through (a) liming (b) phosphating (c) rotating crops (d) growing winter cover crops 2. To provide livestock of good type to consume all feed produced on the farm. 3. To produce the home food supply on the farm as nearly as possible. 4. To improve the farm home and its surroundings through (a) providing electric lights and running water in the home. (b) repairing the farm home. (c) improving the home grounds. PART-TIME CLASSES: This year one class was taught to a group of out-of-school boys at Camp Morgan, the CCC camp which is located five miles away from the school. I met with this group of thirty-two boys one night each week to study problems pertaining to farming. These boys as a group have three projects on the camp grounds: 1. Poultry 2. Bees 3. Rabbits On January 1 of this year, there came aid through the Sevier County Board of Education to provide National Defense Training for out-ofschool rural and urban youth. The supervision of these .classes became the job of the Vocational Agriculture Teachers throughout the State. Our School provided two of these classes to this group. One of these was taught by Mr. Walter Cardwell in woodworking, in which twenty-five boys were enrolled. The other class is now being taught at Pigeon Forge Elementary School House by Mr. Fred Cooper. This course is in elementary electricity, in which twenty students are enrolled. It is hoped that these boys will be better able to do the necessary jobs in preparation for war or in time of war. We have an improved Farm Shop as a result of this training. We now have $264.00 worth of additional equipment for our farm shop. We think this equipment will become the property of Sevier County Board of Education and this will be left with the Agricultural Department of our School. THE FFA CHAPTER: The Future Farmers of America chapter has completed a most successful year. We have taken part in the following outside activities of the School: 1. Showing Dairy Cattle at the County Fair. 2. Exhibiting Farm products, farmshop work, and poultry at the County Fair and at the Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial Fair at Knoxville. 3. Sponsored FFA and Home Economics socials. 4. Livestock and Dairy cattle judging contest at the University of Tennessee in which sixty-eight high school chapters of FFA competed. (Pi Phi won third place in Livestock and Roy McCarter, a senior FFA boy, was high point contestant of the whole contest in which 209 boys entered.) 5. Sponsored Third Annual Parent and Son Banquet. (FFA boys invited their mothers and fathers. Eighty-seven parents and guests attended.) 6. Public Speaking contest at University. (Roy Ogle, a senior FFA boy, placed second in the 5th district which had 14 chapters competing.) 7. FFA Baseball and Basketball teams. 8. Presentation of the FFA cup to best All-around high school girl. 9. Two boys continue to produce Hybrid corn for seed. Last year one boy sold $224.00 worth of seed corn harvested from one acre. 10. Four town boys who are taking agriculture have rented land from the airport and have what appears to be successful Home Gar-dens. Some of these boys have in addition, Home Improvement, and twenty-five to fifty chicks for broilers. 11. CAMP CLEMENTS Five boys and I at-tended the Tennessee FFA camp for one week last summer. (Pi Phi won the athletic award for that week's activities.) 12. FFA field day, the last Saturday in April, found us competing in field meets at Powell Station High School, Knox County, with FFA chapters of the 5th district. The boys did well in the events, but their total points were not enough to surpass the Powell Station FFA. 13. RADIO PROGRAMS. This year the Pi Beta Phi FFA sponsored two programs over WNOX. The first program was presented by four boys who were growing Hybrid corn for seed. The Title of the program was GROWING HYBRID CORN. Our second program was entitled THE AGRICULTURAL CONDITION OF SEVIER . COUNTY AND HOW THE VOCATION-AL AGRICULTURE AT PI BETA PHI PLAYS ITS PART. This program was given by four senior FFA boys. 14. Tennessee FFA Convention was attended THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 53 by five boys and myself in Memphis, Tennessee, April 25 and 26. Our chapter was presented with the camp award, mentioned as a third place winner of the Livestock Judging contest and also that Roy McCarter from II B (1) had made the highest number of points of any boy in the East Tennessee Livestock judging contest. Dot Fox, a junior, and also a Hybrid Corn Grower, was awarded the degree of the Tennessee State planter. Dot plans to try to become an American farmer within the next two years. The fifth district of FFA offered three money awards to the best supervised farming program conducted by a boy last year. Dot won the second prize and the first prize went to a University of Tennessee Freshman boy of the college of agriculture. THE SCHOOL FARM: This year we had eight boys in the Dormitory who did the work on the farm and janitor work in the school houses. Six of these boys took Vocational Agriculture. They were given charge of certain enterprises in which they were responsible in their work. This causes the boy to take more interest in his work and thus a better job is done. Last fall our Jerseys, poultry, hogs, and farm products placed well at our County Fair. We had the Grand Champion animal of the Jersey Show. This year we have 140 white Leghorn hens in our laying flock. 100 white Leghorn sexed baby chicks were bought for replacements in the laying flock next fall. 800 baby chicks were bought and fed to broiler weight for Dining hall and to sell to the hotel. Mountain View Hotel uses all of our extra broilers which we produce and gives us a good price for them. Two modern brooder houses were constructed on the farm by agriculture boys as a part of their training in Agriculture. A water line was laid from the Boys' Dormitory to the incubator house. This makes it possible for us to provide ample water for livestock at the barn without having to carry it.

The driveway has been changed to the side of the house with parking space toward the rear. This gives a solid expanse of lawn in front. Native shrubs surround it. One of the Park men helped us with the landscaping. The little rustic bridge at the side has been moved up the creek a few feet so that the school children do not cross the corner there. With a few more additions on the interior it should be complete. Hardly a customer fails to exclaim over its beauty. Taking it month by month through the year business has been consistently better. The amount of returns remained about the same but they were sent back earlier in the year as a whole. One particular club so far out-distanced all the rest this year they should be mentioned in this report. Berkeley up to June 1 has sold $1,911.80 with the month of June to bring it up to two thousand. The next highest sales record was the New York Club with $970.94. Dallas was a close third. To spoil that picture there is over $5,800 out-standing on our books against clubs. This represents unsold goods or failure to send in money promptly. I am still in hopes the month of June will clear up a great deal of that as our books go SCHOOL URING these last weeks of school Mrs. Weaver has been sorely missed. Perhaps I can give you a brief outline of some of the things that have happened. The grade school was out the latter part of April and the following teachers have been elected for next school year. Mr. Pern Price of. Gatlinburg will remain as Principal. Pauline Sharp, Eleanor Brabson, and Veryl Elder will return from the County. Doris Hatch, Illinois A and Flora Belle De Witt, Colorado B, will also return to us in the Fall. Due to the marriage of Ruth Parker and the resignation of Pauline Morris there will be two new Pi Phis to take their places, Mary Hayward, Arizona A, and Sue Viering, Illinois A. Mr. King, who has been Superintendent for ten years, tendered his resignation. Mr. Fleming will take his place. Cleo Nelson, North Dakota A, has also resigned. Miriam Moore, Kansas B, will be to an auditor the first day of July. The Fall Guild meeting was just over the mountain at the Cherokee Indian Reservation in North Carolina. The spring meeting was in Knoxville as usual, followed by a meeting of Southern Highlanders Inc. at Norris in the afternoon. The Southeastern Arts Association was meeting in Knoxville at the same time. A great number of our things were in their display. Besides attending those three meetings I have visited the John C. Campbell Folk School this past year. The Guild Shop in Asheville has done so well through the years that it was decided to use part of the small surplus to start another shop in the Shenandoah National Park. Arrowcraft, as a member, will have that as another market. We have already had several re-orders but it is too early to know if they will be able to sell as much as Allan-stand has for us. In making out a recent report I find that one third is sold as cash sales to the passing tourists, one sixth wholesale to other shops through the country, and one half by our own alumnae clubs and active chapters. That is a grand record to have kept through the years. Respectfully submitted, ETHEL WEAVER SNOW the Pi Phi to take her place. The new County teacher on the High School staff is to be Margaret Burchfield of Sevierville. -She is graduating with high honors from the University of Tennessee and will go on to summer school to finish her Library training so that she may have charge of the School Library along with her other work. The County board allowed us enough money for one other high school teacher this coming year. It has to be some one who can teach chemistry and I am still hoping some outstanding Pi Phi will offer her services. There is also a position open to a Pi Phi who knows double entry bookkeeping. Mrs. Elizabeth Peck, California B, comes to us very soon as the new Director. The rest of the school staff remains the same. Their reports will speak for themselves. Respectfully submitted, ETHEL WEAVER SNOW \ i \ T EPO Convention, June 21-27, 1942, New Ocean House, Swampscott, Mass. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW WEAVING DEPA ow that the Arrowcraft fiscal year for 1941 is about to pass into history, we can say hat we have produced more weaving during this han in any previous year. We have had a total of 7 women weaving for us which is not our highest ecord but they have earned more during the year han any other group. This year in the eleven aonths ending May 1941 they have earned 12,636.35. In the same period a year ago they tad earned $10,114.27 or a gain of $2,522.08. In )ecember 1940 we reached an all-time high for ,ne month when we paid the weavers $3,196.68. 'he weavers have shown their same loyalty and ooperation throughout the year that they always D. The play "Store Britches," the most ambitious indertaking the Weaver's Guild has ever atempted, was a decided success. The two casts gave 7 performances during the summer tourist season. 'he play was enthusiastically received by those vho saw it. The proceeds of the final performance vere given to the Gatlinburg Public Library and hey also gave $25.00 to the. Red Cross. Five veavers have borrowed from the fund to get ;lasses, one to pipe water into her house, and one a pay for an x-ray of her husband's stomach. They are planning to give the play again as a wrist attraction during July and August with the lea in mind of making it an annual affair whose hief value would be to keep alive in an authentic lay a bit of the fast-disappearing type of mountain amily life. This year the play will be under the omplete direction of Mrs. Phillip Maxwell. The greatest and most serious development as ar as our weaving is concerned during the year 3 the effect that the application of the Fair Labor tandards Act may have. The Southern Highland landicraft Guild has been carrying on negotiaions with the U. S. Department of Labor since 1st March. As this will affect not only Arrowcraft ut all handicraft organizations of the country qually, the Directors of the Guild thought that here is strength in unity and that we would get urther with the negotiations to have the Guild aembers represented as a whole rather than inividually. It is on. this basis that Arrowcraft has been ,articipating. All reports and correspondence that ve sent to Washington have been submitted to 4iss Onken or Mrs. Hagee first for approval. At the request of the Guild last March, as they were anticipating the investigation from Washagton anyway, the Hearings /Branch of the U. S. )epartment of Labor sent one of their staff memers to the annual meeting of the Guild in Knox-file. She stayed in the region three weeks making TMENT 1940-41 an extensive study of the work and set-up of the important centers in which Guild members were located. She stayed four days in Gatlinburg and visited not only Arrowcraft but the other shops as well, as they would have to comply with the law if they are in Interstate Commerce. This would automatically eliminate the price competition with which we have always been faced locally. Because hand-loom weaving would be the most difficult handicraft to readjust, a committee representing the important weaving members of the Guild was appointed with myself as chairman, to make an exhaustive study of weaving that is done in the homes and paid by the piece. This study included not only the producing but the marketing of weaving. The committee met in Gatlinburg on April 18 with seven weaving centers represented. The report of their findings has not yet been sent to the Department of Labor as they are still working on some of the questions that were sent to them by the Department of Labor to be studied. At the present time nothing definite has been decided and the issue is still in the hands of the President of the Guild and the Department of Labor. The future selling prices of weaving are hard to predict with the uncertainty that is attached both to the advancing of the prices for materials and the probable application to handicrafts of the Wage and Hour Act. I have tried to safeguard as much as possible against the continuous advance in the price of materials by buying in quantity supplies of wool and linen before the rise took place. This is only a temporary advantage for as long as the war lasts, prices will continue to change. Wool has gone up recently and linen has already advanced over 100% with the supply uncertain. We have on hand enough staple linen to last us 8 to 12 more months and wool to last 6 to 8 months at our present rate of production with but few additional purchases. Cotton prices have not advanced materially as yet. This will necessarily mean increasing our selling prices on many of the woven articles and the cautious weaving of all our linens. It would help our weaving program tremendously this fall if the Clubs would not over-estimate the linens they will need for their sales and order on the hand-to-mouth plan. Everything that we do not have to weave will conserve our supply of materials that cannot be replaced at the prices we paid for them. I hesitate to overstock in face of the uncertain times ahead. Respectfully submitted, WINOGENE B. REDDING PRINCIPAL'S ANNUAL EPO T, 1940.41 1st' THE 1940-41 school year opened on Tuesday after Labor Day, with the brightest promise of very successful school year. The opening day's nrollment was the largest on record for the high chool, and both pupils and teachers seemed nxious to get down to work. The teaching staff was composed of: William wing, principal, History and Social Science; Ben qeming, Mathematics, Science, and Coach; Cleo Nelson, English and Librarian; William Coe, Vocational Agriculture; Charlotte Herman, Vocational Home Economics; and William Oakes, Vocational Handicrafts. Miss Nelson and Miss Herman, the new members of the staff, while lacking in experience, worked hard at the job and the high school ran along as smoothly as could be expected. The large enrollment made a longer school day THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 49 necessary as more classes had to be taught by the same teaching force. The school day was lengthened from six to eight periods, and the length of the periods changed from sixty to forty-five minutes. A new course in Biology was introduced for the sophomore class and Sociology was added for the seniors. The course of study this year consisted of: English, four units; Science, three units; History, and Social Science, four units; Mathematics, three units; Vocational Agriculture, three units; Vocational Home Economics, three units, and Handicrafts, one unit; a total of twenty-one classes daily. The high school enrollment showed a consider-able increase of the preceding year. This rate of increase will probably continue for two more years and then will level off, unless school busses are added to bring students from other communities.

They won thirteen games and lost JENNIE N][COL MEMO TWENTY years ago, the Jennie Nicol Memorial Health Center moved into the little white cottage that had been the home of the Andrew Ogle family. Through the years of service and friendly understanding, the few cases of the beginning years have grown to hundreds. Methods change as need arises, but the pioneers builded well, and the policies have changed but little. One of the most important phases of the work of the Health Center, is the care of the maternity cases. Twenty-six mothers were on the records for the year, most of whom were under the super-vision of some doctor. Advice on diet and exercise, lists and articles for layettes, preparation for home delivery or for hospitalization were given. Regular check of weight and general condition were kept as often as possible. Some of the new babies had regular nursing care for a few days, and some as well as older babies had formulas or diets regulated as necessary. Many of them have been in for the Friday after-noon clinics many times. One premature baby was fed with a medicine dropper for several days, until she was strong enough to nurse, and kept in a warmed basket in lieu of an incubator. One baby developed pneumonia, with supplementary infection, and lived but twenty-four hours, in spite of every treatment that could be suggested by the specialists in Knoxville. An oxygen tank was even borrowed from a service station and an inhalation mask devised from a paper sack, all to no avail. Henry, aged two and a half, and nearly blind from an attack of meningitis the year previous, one during the regular playing season, and went to the semi-finals in the district tournament. Four-teen players were awarded letters at the close of the season. The Settlement School staff put on the play "Who's Crazy Now" to a large and appreciative audience. The purpose of the play was to raise money for a moving picture machine for the school. The junior class presented a play in the fall and the senior class gave two plays to raise money for their trip to Washington. The trip of the senior class to the nation's capital, was one of the high lights of the school year for the seniors. They worked all year to make the necessary money for transportation. They had a five day trip, going to Washington by way of Natural Bridge and the Skyline Drive. They spent two days sightseeing in Washington and returned home by way of Yorktown, Norfolk, and Virginia Beach. The various clubs of the school had a very active year. The Home Economics club and the FFA furnished much of the social life of the school. The glee club under the direction of Mrs. Chalmers and Miss Nelson furnished the music for commencement. Dr. Stewart W. McClelland, President of , Lincoln Memorial University, delivered the commencement address, and Rev. W. D. Wilkinson preached the Baccalaureate sermon. Twenty seniors received their diplomas. Respectfully submitted, WILLIAM KING, Principal IAL HEALTH CENTE had an eye examination by Dr. Robert Leech of Knoxville. The child seems to do little more than distinguish light from darkness, and there seems little hope of any improvement. Probably at some later date, he may be placed in some school for some sort of training. Little red-headed Marjorie, whose left foot was straightened by Dr. Bagwell, is walking freely. Six months old Margaret has both tiny legs in casts for club foot correction. She is a patient of the Crippled Children's Clinic, and reports there on alternate Fridays for observation, change of cast or treatment. The Crippled Children's work is done under the auspices of the Sevier County Post of the American Legion, and by state funds. School inspections were held at intervals during the year at Gatlinburg, and at the six rural schools. Inoculations for typhoid, diphtheria, and small pox were made as necessary in each place. Talks pertaining to health were ,made in class rooms and in other meetings. The general health of the school children seems to be improving year by year. Fewer are underweight, due to supervised lunches, and increased knowledge of both parents and children. The Sevierville Lions Club has bought glasses for several children of the district, and r sorority aids in the correction of defects. A number of children had tonsils removed, a few had appendectomies, and many visited the dentist. There were innumerable dressings, a few fractures, and many sprains. But the high light of the school health program is the lessening of the old enemy, impetigo. Better living conditions, more balanced 10 \ 50 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW diet, and persistence of treatment, are undoubtedly responsible. Community nursing consists mostly of emergency or special treatment. Post-operative dressings, massage, hypodermics, irrigations, and instruction in home nursing. Several were taken to Cancer or Tuberculosis Clinics, and for X-rays. Three doctors in Sevierville have infirmaries, and rapid ambulance service has made it possible to transport patients quickly and safely. The Loan Closet continues to be of great service. Crutches, rubber sheeting, bed pans, hot water bottles, and ice caps are borrowed in case of need, and returned for the use of others. Night clothing for children and adults, and baby things are used again and again. As always, we are grateful for the cooperation met on every side, from the doctors who so freely give advice and aid, the members of the staff, and of the Fraternity. Above all, we are grateful for the friendship and appreciation of the people of the community. The work of the Health Center seems to go beyond mere physical needs. Worry and unhappiness are as tangible as disease, and a tonic for the ELEMENTA THE Ij[ B (1, Elementary School opened on September 3, 1940 with the following teachers: Eleanor Brabson, primer; Doris Hatch, first grade; Ruth Parker, second grade; Veryle Elder, third grade; Pauline Morris, fourth grade; Pauline Sharp, fifth grade; Flora Belle DeWitt, sixth and seventh grades ; C. Pern Price, eighth grade. For the seventh consecutive year the II B Elementary School has won the cup in the Blue Ribbon contest for the larger schools. This is quite a distinction as no other school in the county, large or small, can equal this record. For the second year the elementary school has been given a rating of 100% in the sanitation program. We are one of the twelve schools in the county to make this record. A number of books for our library were given to us by friends from Muncie, Indiana. Most all system no more necessary than a tonic for morale. It is our sincere hope that the Health Center may continue to stand for those things, whatever they may be, that will make life happier and more healthful for our people.

MARJORIE CHALMERS, R.N. Y SCHOOL the books were fiction. On April 8, 1941, the faculty of the high school and elementary school gave a play, "Who's Crazy Now." In addition to the faculty Mrs. Snow and Miss Redding took part. The purpose of this play was to take the proceeds and apply on a 16 mm. motion picture machine for use of the school. The enrollment for 1940-41 was 285. The average daily attendance was 225. Inattendance, "flu" and other reasons kept this lower than it should have been. The elementary school had its first football team. Out of five games played they did not lose a game and had their goal line crossed only twice during the season. The largest eighth grade class to finish school in the elementary department finished this year. C. PERN PRICE HANDICRAFTS FoR my report I am giving you an exact list of the articles that were made by the high school group for the past year. There were fourteen in this group that finished this year. Five were seniors and nine juniors. There were five of this group who took other classes during this class period. Some few of them came in the afternoons to make some of this time up. I never had the entire group in the shop at the same time. I could not give the organized work that I should have given, because of this. There were some few that be-came quite skilled. If they could go on with this work, they could accomplish something. As it is they can't take another year because they have had two vocational credits and can have only four to graduate. This course gives two. All of the equipment is in first class order. There have been only a few tools lost. A handsaw, hammer, and a pair of side cutting pliers disappeared while the plumbers were here. Every member of the group this year made an article for the school, to be left here. Many thanks for the job and the many favors, Sincerely, WILLIAM O. OAKES HOME ECONOMICS DEPARTMENT ORTY-SEVEN girls were enrolled in Home five were freshmen, ten were sophomores, and FEconomks the largest number in the history twelve were juniors. The seniors were unable to of the Settlement School. Of this group, twentytake Home Economics as an elective because it THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 51 conflicted with their required courses. In the freshman class, the most popular units were those in clothing construction. The girls made simple blouses, skirts, and aprons in the fall to learn how to use the sewing machine and how to follow a commercial pattern. Some of the girls had sewed considerably at home so each girl chose a clothing problem according to her own skill level so that she could learn something new in her class project. At the end of the six weeks' unit in sewing, the class judged the dresses, and on this basis, two achievement awards were made. The awards were pins given by a commercial pattern company. The girls were very proud of their prizes. During the first semester, we also studied personal grooming, etiquette, and breakfast preparation and service. In October, the freshmen gave an afternoon tea for their mothers and the school staff. This was the climax of their study of manners, introductions, and the art of being a hostess. During the foods units the girls were divided into families for the purpose of working together in planning and preparing the food. Each family served a breakfast in early December, inviting one of the elementary school teachers as guest. In the second semester the freshmen studied child care and development, using their own brothers and sisters at home for observation; preparation and serving of luncheons; school lunches; and food for outdoor hikes and picnics. The sophomore class seemed to be most interested in the foods units. In our first unit food preservation, we canned tomatoes, and apple sauce, and made orange marmalade and apple jelly. As a result of this study, two of the girls made jelly for home projects. Awards similar to those the freshmen received were given the sophomores on the completion of their fall wool dresses. The weaving for the sophomores worked out very well this year because there was an even number of girls in the class so that each pair could work on one loom. Three of our six weeks were spent in making the warps and in setting up the looms for weaving. Each girl then wove a sampler, a towel, and a pillow top. While half the girls were weaving, the others were sewing on baby garments for the American Red Cross. Other units that the sophomores studied included: elements of nutrition, personal grooming, and luncheon preparation and service. 0 MITO THE year of 1940-41 has been a very busy one. As in any household, looking back, it is hard to say what has been accomplished. The culinary department has been taken care of by Belle Lowe and Mrs. Lurie Hurst, and the necessary upkeep such as mending, new curtains, helping the boys and girls, has fallen to me. Two of our girls left us in April to ride the bus to school, but I replaced them by another. The juniors were especially interested in individual development, so our year's work was planned along that line. The first semester they studied personality improvement, personal grooming, clothing budgets and wardrobes, and clothing construction. Two of the girls made wool suits, several made afternoon dresses, and the others made wool school dresses. One week was spent in the, study of vocations for girls. Nursing, office work, and elementary school teaching were especially interesting to the class. The second semester the juniors took up special party cookery, food and health, textiles, clothing construction, and outdoor cookery. At Christmas time, the sophomores planned the menu, decorated, and served the annual dinner for the faculty. The juniors were in charge of food preparation. This spring the juniors planned and prepared the food for the F.F.A. boys and their parents, and the freshmen and sophomores decorated and served. Ninety guests were served in the general science laboratory. Four girls went to the Open House at the University of Tennessee. One junior modelled a two-piece wool dress and a sophomore modelled a spring skirt and jerkin. In March, the juniors took a field trip to Knoxville to visit the furniture stores, after studying about the different types of furnishings suitable for their own homes. Each girl completed three home projects, in addition to her class work. Sewing seemed to be the most popular type of project. Among the projects were: quilts, baby and children's clothes, curtains, pillow cases, slip covers for chairs, and all types of clothes for the girls themselves. Some of the food projects were: baking; preparation of breakfasts, luncheons, and suppers; and a study of pastries. The Home Economics Club had fifty-five members this year. Bi-weekly meetings were held, with programs planned by the girls at each meeting. From November through March, the Home Economics teacher and the Agriculture teacher con-ducted a joint class for adult men and women at the Laurel Grove School in Wear's Valley. The classes met an hour and a half every two weeks. Among the topics discussed for women were: home gardens, menu planning, food and health, and canning. Respectfully submitted, CHARLOTTE HERMAN MS, 1940-41 I have bought five unfinished dressers for th, girls' dormitory and finished them, and had tit floor in the dining room sanded and waxed, an( with Mrs. Hagee's assistance bought a linoleun rug for "Miss Georgic's" room. I would recommend that the kitchen be painted and if it is possible that an electric mixer b purchased for the kitchen. Respectfully submitted, ANNETTE MORSE 5 2 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE ALL DAY CLASSES: This year's enrollment in this group reached a total of fifty-one boys. Three classes were taught in Vocational Agriculture. These classes consisted of twenty-five freshman boys, another class was made up of seventeen sophomores and still another consisted of eight iunior and senior boys. This year we had thirty-four of the fifty-one beginning boys to complete the entire school year. The remaining thirty-foul boys are at present conducting complete supervised Farming Programs. EVENING SCHOOL CLASSES: One night school was conducted in the Laurel Grove Community for those men who are established in the business of farming. This adult class I teach at least one night out of each month and this continues throughout the year. This year we had seventeen meetings with a total of fifty-three farmers enrolled. Our course of study is based on the needs of the community. We made surveys to determine what were the farming and living conditions of the Laurel Grove Community. After spending one class meeting in a discussion of our data, the farmers came to the conclusion that their greatest problem was low income. Farmers were then led to set up objectives which would increase their farm income. They were: 1. To increase soil fertility through (a) liming (b) phosphating (c) rotating crops (d) growing winter cover crops 2. To provide livestock of good type to consume all feed produced on the farm. 3. To produce the home food supply on the farm as nearly as possible. 4. To improve the farm home and its surroundings through (a) providing electric lights and running water in the home. (b) repairing the farm home. (c) improving the home grounds. PART-TIME CLASSES: This year one class was taught to a group of out-of-school boys at Camp Morgan, the CCC camp which is located five miles away from the school. I met with this group of thirty-two boys one night each week to study problems pertaining to farming. These boys as a group have three projects on the camp grounds: 1. Poultry 2. Bees 3. Rabbits On January 1 of this year, there came aid through the Sevier County Board of Education to provide National Defense Training for out-ofschool rural and urban youth. The supervision of these .classes became the job of the Vocational Agriculture Teachers throughout the State. Our School provided two of these classes to this group. One of these was taught by Mr. Walter Cardwell in woodworking, in which twenty-five boys were enrolled. The other class is now being taught at Pigeon Forge Elementary School House by Mr. Fred Cooper. This course is in elementary electricity, in which twenty students are enrolled. It is hoped that these boys will be better able to do the necessary jobs in preparation for war or in time of war. We have an improved Farm Shop as a result of this training. We now have $264.00 worth of additional equipment for our farm shop. We think this equipment will become the property of Sevier County Board of Education and this will be left with the Agricultural Department of our School. THE FFA CHAPTER: The Future Farmers of America chapter has completed a most successful year. We have taken part in the following outside activities of the School: 1. Showing Dairy Cattle at the County Fair. 2. Exhibiting Farm products, farmshop work, and poultry at the County Fair and at the Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial Fair at Knoxville. 3. Sponsored FFA and Home Economics socials. 4. Livestock and Dairy cattle judging contest at the University of Tennessee in which sixty-eight high school chapters of FFA competed. (Pi Phi won third place in Livestock and Roy McCarter, a senior FFA boy, was high point contestant of the whole contest in which 209 boys entered.) 5. Sponsored Third Annual Parent and Son Banquet. (FFA boys invited their mothers and fathers. Eighty-seven parents and guests attended.) 6. Public Speaking contest at University. (Roy Ogle, a senior FFA boy, placed second in the 5th district which had 14 chapters competing.) 7. FFA Baseball and Basketball teams. 8. Presentation of the FFA cup to best All-around high school girl. 9. Two boys continue to produce Hybrid corn for seed. Last year one boy sold $224.00 worth of seed corn harvested from one acre. 10. Four town boys who are taking agriculture have rented land from the airport and have what appears to be successful Home Gar-dens. Some of these boys have in addition, Home Improvement, and twenty-five to fifty chicks for broilers. 11. CAMP CLEMENTS Five boys and I at-tended the Tennessee FFA camp for one week last summer. (Pi Phi won the athletic award for that week's activities.) 12. FFA field day, the last Saturday in April, found us competing in field meets at Powell Station High School, Knox County, with FFA chapters of the 5th district. The boys did well in the events, but their total points were not enough to surpass the Powell Station FFA. 13. RADIO PROGRAMS. This year the Pi Beta Phi FFA sponsored two programs over WNOX. The first program was presented by four boys who were growing Hybrid corn for seed. The Title of the program was GROWING HYBRID CORN. Our second program was entitled THE AGRICULTURAL CONDITION OF SEVIER . COUNTY AND HOW THE VOCATION-AL AGRICULTURE AT PI BETA PHI PLAYS ITS PART. This program was given by four senior FFA boys. 14. Tennessee FFA Convention was attended THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 53 by five boys and myself in Memphis, Tennessee, April 25 and 26. Our chapter was presented with the camp award, mentioned as a third place winner of the Livestock Judging contest and also that Roy McCarter from II B (1) had made the highest number of points of any boy in the East Tennessee Livestock judging contest. Dot Fox, a junior, and also a Hybrid Corn Grower, was awarded the degree of the Tennessee State planter. Dot plans to try to become an American farmer within the next two years. The fifth district of FFA offered three money awards to the best supervised farming program conducted by a boy last year. Dot won the second prize and the first prize went to a University of Tennessee Freshman boy of the college of agriculture. THE SCHOOL FARM: This year we had eight boys in the Dormitory who did the work on the farm and janitor work in the school houses. Six of these boys took Vocational Agriculture. They were given charge of certain enterprises in which they were responsible in their work. This causes the boy to take more interest in his work and thus a better job is done. Last fall our Jerseys, poultry, hogs, and farm products placed well at our County Fair. We had the Grand Champion animal of the Jersey Show. This year we have 140 white Leghorn hens in our laying flock. 100 white Leghorn sexed baby chicks were bought for replacements in the laying flock next fall. 800 baby chicks were bought and fed to broiler weight for Dining hall and to sell to the hotel. Mountain View Hotel uses all of our extra broilers which we produce and gives us a good price for them. Two modern brooder houses were constructed on the farm by agriculture boys as a part of their training in Agriculture. A water line was laid from the Boys' Dormitory to the incubator house. This makes it possible for us to provide ample water for livestock at the barn without having to carry it. As to the financial standing of the farm I pre-sent the following: Month Sold to Farm Farm Kitchen Expense Receipts July $ 229.09 $ 6.95 $ 37.93 August 194.36 412.23 4.00 September 145.69 80.71 2.00 October 205.49 152.68 23.35 November 145.25 273.76 36.16 December 141.01 254.62 19.00 January 157.52 3.88 64.48 February 150.05 273.92 72.10 March 264.51 90.22 April 236.69 155.81 27.63 May 175.20 336.78 247.62 Total $2,044.86 $2,052.45 $534.27 Sold to kitchen plus cash income $2,579.13 Total income less expenses 526.68 ).

The driveway has been changed to the side of the house with parking space toward the rear. This gives a solid expanse of lawn in front. Native shrubs surround it. One of the Park men helped us with the landscaping. The little rustic bridge at the side has been moved up the creek a few feet so that the school children do not cross the corner there. With a few more additions on the interior it should be complete. Hardly a customer fails to exclaim over its beauty. Taking it month by month through the year business has been consistently better. The amount of returns remained about the same but they were sent back earlier in the year as a whole. One particular club so far out-distanced all the rest this year they should be mentioned in this report. Berkeley up to June 1 has sold $1,911.80 with the month of June to bring it up to two thousand. The next highest sales record was the New York Club with $970.94. Dallas was a close third. To spoil that picture there is over $5,800 out-standing on our books against clubs. This represents unsold goods or failure to send in money promptly. I am still in hopes the month of June will clear up a great deal of that as our books go SCHOOL URING these last weeks of school Mrs. Weaver has been sorely missed. Perhaps I can give you a brief outline of some of the things that have happened. The grade school was out the latter part of April and the following teachers have been elected for next school year. Mr. Pern Price of. Gatlinburg will remain as Principal. Pauline Sharp, Eleanor Brabson, and Veryl Elder will return from the County. Doris Hatch, Illinois A and Flora Belle De Witt, Colorado B, will also return to us in the Fall. Due to the marriage of Ruth Parker and the resignation of Pauline Morris there will be two new Pi Phis to take their places, Mary Hayward, Arizona A, and Sue Viering, Illinois A. Mr. King, who has been Superintendent for ten years, tendered his resignation. Mr. Fleming will take his place. Cleo Nelson, North Dakota A, has also resigned. Miriam Moore, Kansas B, will be to an auditor the first day of July. The Fall Guild meeting was just over the mountain at the Cherokee Indian Reservation in North Carolina. The spring meeting was in Knoxville as usual, followed by a meeting of Southern Highlanders Inc. at Norris in the afternoon. The Southeastern Arts Association was meeting in Knoxville at the same time. A great number of our things were in their display. Besides attending those three meetings I have visited the John C. Campbell Folk School this past year. The Guild Shop in Asheville has done so well through the years that it was decided to use part of the small surplus to start another shop in the Shenandoah National Park. Arrowcraft, as a member, will have that as another market. We have already had several re-orders but it is too early to know if they will be able to sell as much as Allan-stand has for us. In making out a recent report I find that one third is sold as cash sales to the passing tourists, one sixth wholesale to other shops through the country, and one half by our own alumnae clubs and active chapters. That is a grand record to have kept through the years. Respectfully submitted, ETHEL WEAVER SNOW the Pi Phi to take her place. The new County teacher on the High School staff is to be Margaret Burchfield of Sevierville. -She is graduating with high honors from the University of Tennessee and will go on to summer school to finish her Library training so that she may have charge of the School Library along with her other work. The County board allowed us enough money for one other high school teacher this coming year. It has to be some one who can teach chemistry and I am still hoping some outstanding Pi Phi will offer her services. There is also a position open to a Pi Phi who knows double entry bookkeeping. Mrs. Elizabeth Peck, California B, comes to us very soon as the new Director. The rest of the school staff remains the same. Their reports will speak for themselves. Respectfully submitted, ETHEL WEAVER SNOW \ i \ T EPO Convention, June 21-27, 1942, New Ocean House, Swampscott, Mass. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW WEAVING DEPA ow that the Arrowcraft fiscal year for 1941 is about to pass into history, we can say hat we have produced more weaving during this han in any previous year. We have had a total of 7 women weaving for us which is not our highest ecord but they have earned more during the year han any other group. This year in the eleven aonths ending May 1941 they have earned 12,636.35. In the same period a year ago they tad earned $10,114.27 or a gain of $2,522.08. In )ecember 1940 we reached an all-time high for ,ne month when we paid the weavers $3,196.68. 'he weavers have shown their same loyalty and ooperation throughout the year that they always D. The play "Store Britches," the most ambitious indertaking the Weaver's Guild has ever atempted, was a decided success. The two casts gave 7 performances during the summer tourist season. 'he play was enthusiastically received by those vho saw it. The proceeds of the final performance vere given to the Gatlinburg Public Library and hey also gave $25.00 to the. Red Cross. Five veavers have borrowed from the fund to get ;lasses, one to pipe water into her house, and one a pay for an x-ray of her husband's stomach. They are planning to give the play again as a wrist attraction during July and August with the lea in mind of making it an annual affair whose hief value would be to keep alive in an authentic lay a bit of the fast-disappearing type of mountain amily life. This year the play will be under the omplete direction of Mrs. Phillip Maxwell. The greatest and most serious development as ar as our weaving is concerned during the year 3 the effect that the application of the Fair Labor tandards Act may have. The Southern Highland landicraft Guild has been carrying on negotiaions with the U. S. Department of Labor since 1st March. As this will affect not only Arrowcraft ut all handicraft organizations of the country qually, the Directors of the Guild thought that here is strength in unity and that we would get urther with the negotiations to have the Guild aembers represented as a whole rather than inividually. It is on. this basis that Arrowcraft has been ,articipating. All reports and correspondence that ve sent to Washington have been submitted to 4iss Onken or Mrs. Hagee first for approval. At the request of the Guild last March, as they were anticipating the investigation from Washagton anyway, the Hearings /Branch of the U. S. )epartment of Labor sent one of their staff memers to the annual meeting of the Guild in Knox-file. She stayed in the region three weeks making TMENT 1940-41 an extensive study of the work and set-up of the important centers in which Guild members were located. She stayed four days in Gatlinburg and visited not only Arrowcraft but the other shops as well, as they would have to comply with the law if they are in Interstate Commerce. This would automatically eliminate the price competition with which we have always been faced locally. Because hand-loom weaving would be the most difficult handicraft to readjust, a committee representing the important weaving members of the Guild was appointed with myself as chairman, to make an exhaustive study of weaving that is done in the homes and paid by the piece. This study included not only the producing but the marketing of weaving. The committee met in Gatlinburg on April 18 with seven weaving centers represented. The report of their findings has not yet been sent to the Department of Labor as they are still working on some of the questions that were sent to them by the Department of Labor to be studied. At the present time nothing definite has been decided and the issue is still in the hands of the President of the Guild and the Department of Labor. The future selling prices of weaving are hard to predict with the uncertainty that is attached both to the advancing of the prices for materials and the probable application to handicrafts of the Wage and Hour Act. I have tried to safeguard as much as possible against the continuous advance in the price of materials by buying in quantity supplies of wool and linen before the rise took place. This is only a temporary advantage for as long as the war lasts, prices will continue to change. Wool has gone up recently and linen has already advanced over 100% with the supply uncertain. We have on hand enough staple linen to last us 8 to 12 more months and wool to last 6 to 8 months at our present rate of production with but few additional purchases. Cotton prices have not advanced materially as yet. This will necessarily mean increasing our selling prices on many of the woven articles and the cautious weaving of all our linens. It would help our weaving program tremendously this fall if the Clubs would not over-estimate the linens they will need for their sales and order on the hand-to-mouth plan. Everything that we do not have to weave will conserve our supply of materials that cannot be replaced at the prices we paid for them. I hesitate to overstock in face of the uncertain times ahead. Respectfully submitted, WINOGENE B. REDDING PRINCIPAL'S ANNUAL EPO T, 1940.41 1st' THE 1940-41 school year opened on Tuesday after Labor Day, with the brightest promise of very successful school year. The opening day's nrollment was the largest on record for the high chool, and both pupils and teachers seemed nxious to get down to work. The teaching staff was composed of: William wing, principal, History and Social Science; Ben qeming, Mathematics, Science, and Coach; Cleo Nelson, English and Librarian; William Coe, Vocational Agriculture; Charlotte Herman, Vocational Home Economics; and William Oakes, Vocational Handicrafts. Miss Nelson and Miss Herman, the new members of the staff, while lacking in experience, worked hard at the job and the high school ran along as smoothly as could be expected. The large enrollment made a longer school day THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 49 necessary as more classes had to be taught by the same teaching force. The school day was lengthened from six to eight periods, and the length of the periods changed from sixty to forty-five minutes. A new course in Biology was introduced for the sophomore class and Sociology was added for the seniors. The course of study this year consisted of: English, four units; Science, three units; History, and Social Science, four units; Mathematics, three units; Vocational Agriculture, three units; Vocational Home Economics, three units, and Handicrafts, one unit; a total of twenty-one classes daily. The high school enrollment showed a consider-able increase of the preceding year. This rate of increase will probably continue for two more years and then will level off, unless school busses are added to bring students from other communities.

They won thirteen games and lost JENNIE N][COL MEMO TWENTY years ago, the Jennie Nicol Memorial Health Center moved into the little white cottage that had been the home of the Andrew Ogle family. Through the years of service and friendly understanding, the few cases of the beginning years have grown to hundreds. Methods change as need arises, but the pioneers builded well, and the policies have changed but little. One of the most important phases of the work of the Health Center, is the care of the maternity cases. Twenty-six mothers were on the records for the year, most of whom were under the super-vision of some doctor. Advice on diet and exercise, lists and articles for layettes, preparation for home delivery or for hospitalization were given. Regular check of weight and general condition were kept as often as possible. Some of the new babies had regular nursing care for a few days, and some as well as older babies had formulas or diets regulated as necessary. Many of them have been in for the Friday after-noon clinics many times. One premature baby was fed with a medicine dropper for several days, until she was strong enough to nurse, and kept in a warmed basket in lieu of an incubator. One baby developed pneumonia, with supplementary infection, and lived but twenty-four hours, in spite of every treatment that could be suggested by the specialists in Knoxville. An oxygen tank was even borrowed from a service station and an inhalation mask devised from a paper sack, all to no avail. Henry, aged two and a half, and nearly blind from an attack of meningitis the year previous, one during the regular playing season, and went to the semi-finals in the district tournament. Four-teen players were awarded letters at the close of the season. The Settlement School staff put on the play "Who's Crazy Now" to a large and appreciative audience. The purpose of the play was to raise money for a moving picture machine for the school. The junior class presented a play in the fall and the senior class gave two plays to raise money for their trip to Washington. The trip of the senior class to the nation's capital, was one of the high lights of the school year for the seniors. They worked all year to make the necessary money for transportation. They had a five day trip, going to Washington by way of Natural Bridge and the Skyline Drive. They spent two days sightseeing in Washington and returned home by way of Yorktown, Norfolk, and Virginia Beach. The various clubs of the school had a very active year. The Home Economics club and the FFA furnished much of the social life of the school. The glee club under the direction of Mrs. Chalmers and Miss Nelson furnished the music for commencement. Dr. Stewart W. McClelland, President of , Lincoln Memorial University, delivered the commencement address, and Rev. W. D. Wilkinson preached the Baccalaureate sermon. Twenty seniors received their diplomas. Respectfully submitted, WILLIAM KING, Principal IAL HEALTH CENTE had an eye examination by Dr. Robert Leech of Knoxville. The child seems to do little more than distinguish light from darkness, and there seems little hope of any improvement. Probably at some later date, he may be placed in some school for some sort of training. Little red-headed Marjorie, whose left foot was straightened by Dr. Bagwell, is walking freely. Six months old Margaret has both tiny legs in casts for club foot correction. She is a patient of the Crippled Children's Clinic, and reports there on alternate Fridays for observation, change of cast or treatment. The Crippled Children's work is done under the auspices of the Sevier County Post of the American Legion, and by state funds. School inspections were held at intervals during the year at Gatlinburg, and at the six rural schools. Inoculations for typhoid, diphtheria, and small pox were made as necessary in each place. Talks pertaining to health were ,made in class rooms and in other meetings. The general health of the school children seems to be improving year by year. Fewer are underweight, due to supervised lunches, and increased knowledge of both parents and children. The Sevierville Lions Club has bought glasses for several children of the district, and r sorority aids in the correction of defects. A number of children had tonsils removed, a few had appendectomies, and many visited the dentist. There were innumerable dressings, a few fractures, and many sprains. But the high light of the school health program is the lessening of the old enemy, impetigo. Better living conditions, more balanced 10 \ 50 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW diet, and persistence of treatment, are undoubtedly responsible. Community nursing consists mostly of emergency or special treatment. Post-operative dressings, massage, hypodermics, irrigations, and instruction in home nursing. Several were taken to Cancer or Tuberculosis Clinics, and for X-rays. Three doctors in Sevierville have infirmaries, and rapid ambulance service has made it possible to transport patients quickly and safely. The Loan Closet continues to be of great service. Crutches, rubber sheeting, bed pans, hot water bottles, and ice caps are borrowed in case of need, and returned for the use of others. Night clothing for children and adults, and baby things are used again and again. As always, we are grateful for the cooperation met on every side, from the doctors who so freely give advice and aid, the members of the staff, and of the Fraternity. Above all, we are grateful for the friendship and appreciation of the people of the community. The work of the Health Center seems to go beyond mere physical needs. Worry and unhappiness are as tangible as disease, and a tonic for the ELEMENTA THE Ij[ B (1, Elementary School opened on September 3, 1940 with the following teachers: Eleanor Brabson, primer; Doris Hatch, first grade; Ruth Parker, second grade; Veryle Elder, third grade; Pauline Morris, fourth grade; Pauline Sharp, fifth grade; Flora Belle DeWitt, sixth and seventh grades ; C. Pern Price, eighth grade. For the seventh consecutive year the II B Elementary School has won the cup in the Blue Ribbon contest for the larger schools. This is quite a distinction as no other school in the county, large or small, can equal this record. For the second year the elementary school has been given a rating of 100% in the sanitation program. We are one of the twelve schools in the county to make this record. A number of books for our library were given to us by friends from Muncie, Indiana. Most all system no more necessary than a tonic for morale. It is our sincere hope that the Health Center may continue to stand for those things, whatever they may be, that will make life happier and more healthful for our people.

MARJORIE CHALMERS, R.N. Y SCHOOL the books were fiction. On April 8, 1941, the faculty of the high school and elementary school gave a play, "Who's Crazy Now." In addition to the faculty Mrs. Snow and Miss Redding took part. The purpose of this play was to take the proceeds and apply on a 16 mm. motion picture machine for use of the school. The enrollment for 1940-41 was 285. The average daily attendance was 225. Inattendance, "flu" and other reasons kept this lower than it should have been. The elementary school had its first football team. Out of five games played they did not lose a game and had their goal line crossed only twice during the season. The largest eighth grade class to finish school in the elementary department finished this year. C. PERN PRICE HANDICRAFTS FoR my report I am giving you an exact list of the articles that were made by the high school group for the past year. There were fourteen in this group that finished this year. Five were seniors and nine juniors. There were five of this group who took other classes during this class period. Some few of them came in the afternoons to make some of this time up. I never had the entire group in the shop at the same time. I could not give the organized work that I should have given, because of this. There were some few that be-came quite skilled. If they could go on with this work, they could accomplish something. As it is they can't take another year because they have had two vocational credits and can have only four to graduate. This course gives two. All of the equipment is in first class order. There have been only a few tools lost. A handsaw, hammer, and a pair of side cutting pliers disappeared while the plumbers were here. Every member of the group this year made an article for the school, to be left here. Many thanks for the job and the many favors, Sincerely, WILLIAM O. OAKES HOME ECONOMICS DEPARTMENT ORTY-SEVEN girls were enrolled in Home five were freshmen, ten were sophomores, and FEconomks the largest number in the history twelve were juniors. The seniors were unable to of the Settlement School. Of this group, twentytake Home Economics as an elective because it THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 51 conflicted with their required courses. In the freshman class, the most popular units were those in clothing construction. The girls made simple blouses, skirts, and aprons in the fall to learn how to use the sewing machine and how to follow a commercial pattern. Some of the girls had sewed considerably at home so each girl chose a clothing problem according to her own skill level so that she could learn something new in her class project. At the end of the six weeks' unit in sewing, the class judged the dresses, and on this basis, two achievement awards were made. The awards were pins given by a commercial pattern company. The girls were very proud of their prizes. During the first semester, we also studied personal grooming, etiquette, and breakfast preparation and service. In October, the freshmen gave an afternoon tea for their mothers and the school staff. This was the climax of their study of manners, introductions, and the art of being a hostess. During the foods units the girls were divided into families for the purpose of working together in planning and preparing the food. Each family served a breakfast in early December, inviting one of the elementary school teachers as guest. In the second semester the freshmen studied child care and development, using their own brothers and sisters at home for observation; preparation and serving of luncheons; school lunches; and food for outdoor hikes and picnics. The sophomore class seemed to be most interested in the foods units. In our first unit food preservation, we canned tomatoes, and apple sauce, and made orange marmalade and apple jelly. As a result of this study, two of the girls made jelly for home projects. Awards similar to those the freshmen received were given the sophomores on the completion of their fall wool dresses. The weaving for the sophomores worked out very well this year because there was an even number of girls in the class so that each pair could work on one loom. Three of our six weeks were spent in making the warps and in setting up the looms for weaving. Each girl then wove a sampler, a towel, and a pillow top. While half the girls were weaving, the others were sewing on baby garments for the American Red Cross. Other units that the sophomores studied included: elements of nutrition, personal grooming, and luncheon preparation and service. 0 MITO THE year of 1940-41 has been a very busy one. As in any household, looking back, it is hard to say what has been accomplished. The culinary department has been taken care of by Belle Lowe and Mrs. Lurie Hurst, and the necessary upkeep such as mending, new curtains, helping the boys and girls, has fallen to me. Two of our girls left us in April to ride the bus to school, but I replaced them by another. The juniors were especially interested in individual development, so our year's work was planned along that line. The first semester they studied personality improvement, personal grooming, clothing budgets and wardrobes, and clothing construction. Two of the girls made wool suits, several made afternoon dresses, and the others made wool school dresses. One week was spent in the, study of vocations for girls. Nursing, office work, and elementary school teaching were especially interesting to the class. The second semester the juniors took up special party cookery, food and health, textiles, clothing construction, and outdoor cookery. At Christmas time, the sophomores planned the menu, decorated, and served the annual dinner for the faculty. The juniors were in charge of food preparation. This spring the juniors planned and prepared the food for the F.F.A. boys and their parents, and the freshmen and sophomores decorated and served. Ninety guests were served in the general science laboratory. Four girls went to the Open House at the University of Tennessee. One junior modelled a two-piece wool dress and a sophomore modelled a spring skirt and jerkin. In March, the juniors took a field trip to Knoxville to visit the furniture stores, after studying about the different types of furnishings suitable for their own homes. Each girl completed three home projects, in addition to her class work. Sewing seemed to be the most popular type of project. Among the projects were: quilts, baby and children's clothes, curtains, pillow cases, slip covers for chairs, and all types of clothes for the girls themselves. Some of the food projects were: baking; preparation of breakfasts, luncheons, and suppers; and a study of pastries. The Home Economics Club had fifty-five members this year. Bi-weekly meetings were held, with programs planned by the girls at each meeting. From November through March, the Home Economics teacher and the Agriculture teacher con-ducted a joint class for adult men and women at the Laurel Grove School in Wear's Valley. The classes met an hour and a half every two weeks. Among the topics discussed for women were: home gardens, menu planning, food and health, and canning. Respectfully submitted, CHARLOTTE HERMAN MS, 1940-41 I have bought five unfinished dressers for th, girls' dormitory and finished them, and had tit floor in the dining room sanded and waxed, an( with Mrs. Hagee's assistance bought a linoleun rug for "Miss Georgic's" room. I would recommend that the kitchen be painted and if it is possible that an electric mixer b purchased for the kitchen. Respectfully submitted, ANNETTE MORSE 5 2 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE ALL DAY CLASSES: This year's enrollment in this group reached a total of fifty-one boys. Three classes were taught in Vocational Agriculture. These classes consisted of twenty-five freshman boys, another class was made up of seventeen sophomores and still another consisted of eight iunior and senior boys. This year we had thirty-four of the fifty-one beginning boys to complete the entire school year. The remaining thirty-foul boys are at present conducting complete supervised Farming Programs. EVENING SCHOOL CLASSES: One night school was conducted in the Laurel Grove Community for those men who are established in the business of farming. This adult class I teach at least one night out of each month and this continues throughout the year. This year we had seventeen meetings with a total of fifty-three farmers enrolled. Our course of study is based on the needs of the community. We made surveys to determine what were the farming and living conditions of the Laurel Grove Community. After spending one class meeting in a discussion of our data, the farmers came to the conclusion that their greatest problem was low income. Farmers were then led to set up objectives which would increase their farm income. They were: 1. To increase soil fertility through (a) liming (b) phosphating (c) rotating crops (d) growing winter cover crops 2. To provide livestock of good type to consume all feed produced on the farm. 3. To produce the home food supply on the farm as nearly as possible. 4. To improve the farm home and its surroundings through (a) providing electric lights and running water in the home. (b) repairing the farm home. (c) improving the home grounds. PART-TIME CLASSES: This year one class was taught to a group of out-of-school boys at Camp Morgan, the CCC camp which is located five miles away from the school. I met with this group of thirty-two boys one night each week to study problems pertaining to farming. These boys as a group have three projects on the camp grounds: 1. Poultry 2. Bees 3. Rabbits On January 1 of this year, there came aid through the Sevier County Board of Education to provide National Defense Training for out-ofschool rural and urban youth. The supervision of these .classes became the job of the Vocational Agriculture Teachers throughout the State. Our School provided two of these classes to this group. One of these was taught by Mr. Walter Cardwell in woodworking, in which twenty-five boys were enrolled. The other class is now being taught at Pigeon Forge Elementary School House by Mr. Fred Cooper. This course is in elementary electricity, in which twenty students are enrolled. It is hoped that these boys will be better able to do the necessary jobs in preparation for war or in time of war. We have an improved Farm Shop as a result of this training. We now have $264.00 worth of additional equipment for our farm shop. We think this equipment will become the property of Sevier County Board of Education and this will be left with the Agricultural Department of our School. THE FFA CHAPTER: The Future Farmers of America chapter has completed a most successful year. We have taken part in the following outside activities of the School: 1. Showing Dairy Cattle at the County Fair. 2. Exhibiting Farm products, farmshop work, and poultry at the County Fair and at the Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial Fair at Knoxville. 3. Sponsored FFA and Home Economics socials. 4. Livestock and Dairy cattle judging contest at the University of Tennessee in which sixty-eight high school chapters of FFA competed. (Pi Phi won third place in Livestock and Roy McCarter, a senior FFA boy, was high point contestant of the whole contest in which 209 boys entered.) 5. Sponsored Third Annual Parent and Son Banquet. (FFA boys invited their mothers and fathers. Eighty-seven parents and guests attended.) 6. Public Speaking contest at University. (Roy Ogle, a senior FFA boy, placed second in the 5th district which had 14 chapters competing.) 7. FFA Baseball and Basketball teams. 8. Presentation of the FFA cup to best All-around high school girl. 9. Two boys continue to produce Hybrid corn for seed. Last year one boy sold $224.00 worth of seed corn harvested from one acre. 10. Four town boys who are taking agriculture have rented land from the airport and have what appears to be successful Home Gar-dens. Some of these boys have in addition, Home Improvement, and twenty-five to fifty chicks for broilers. 11. CAMP CLEMENTS Five boys and I at-tended the Tennessee FFA camp for one week last summer. (Pi Phi won the athletic award for that week's activities.) 12. FFA field day, the last Saturday in April, found us competing in field meets at Powell Station High School, Knox County, with FFA chapters of the 5th district. The boys did well in the events, but their total points were not enough to surpass the Powell Station FFA. 13. RADIO PROGRAMS. This year the Pi Beta Phi FFA sponsored two programs over WNOX. The first program was presented by four boys who were growing Hybrid corn for seed. The Title of the program was GROWING HYBRID CORN. Our second program was entitled THE AGRICULTURAL CONDITION OF SEVIER . COUNTY AND HOW THE VOCATION-AL AGRICULTURE AT PI BETA PHI PLAYS ITS PART. This program was given by four senior FFA boys. 14. Tennessee FFA Convention was attended THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 53 by five boys and myself in Memphis, Tennessee, April 25 and 26. Our chapter was presented with the camp award, mentioned as a third place winner of the Livestock Judging contest and also that Roy McCarter from II B (1) had made the highest number of points of any boy in the East Tennessee Livestock judging contest. Dot Fox, a junior, and also a Hybrid Corn Grower, was awarded the degree of the Tennessee State planter. Dot plans to try to become an American farmer within the next two years. The fifth district of FFA offered three money awards to the best supervised farming program conducted by a boy last year. Dot won the second prize and the first prize went to a University of Tennessee Freshman boy of the college of agriculture. THE SCHOOL FARM: This year we had eight boys in the Dormitory who did the work on the farm and janitor work in the school houses. Six of these boys took Vocational Agriculture. They were given charge of certain enterprises in which they were responsible in their work. This causes the boy to take more interest in his work and thus a better job is done. Last fall our Jerseys, poultry, hogs, and farm products placed well at our County Fair. We had the Grand Champion animal of the Jersey Show. This year we have 140 white Leghorn hens in our laying flock. 100 white Leghorn sexed baby chicks were bought for replacements in the laying flock next fall. 800 baby chicks were bought and fed to broiler weight for Dining hall and to sell to the hotel. Mountain View Hotel uses all of our extra broilers which we produce and gives us a good price for them. Two modern brooder houses were constructed on the farm by agriculture boys as a part of their training in Agriculture. A water line was laid from the Boys' Dormitory to the incubator house. This makes it possible for us to provide ample water for livestock at the barn without having to carry it. As to the financial standing of the farm I pre-sent the following: Month Sold to Farm Farm Kitchen Expense Receipts July $ 229.09 $ 6.95 $ 37.93 August 194.36 412.23 4.00 September 145.69 80.71 2.00 October 205.49 152.68 23.35 November 145.25 273.76 36.16 December 141.01 254.62 19.00 January 157.52 3.88 64.48 February 150.05 273.92 72.10 March 264.51 90.22 April 236.69 155.81 27.63 May 175.20 336.78 247.62 Total $2,044.86 $2,052.45 $534.27 Sold to kitchen plus cash income $2,579.13 Total income less expenses 526.68 ).

At the request of the Guild last March, as they were anticipating the investigation from Washagton anyway, the Hearings /Branch of the U. S. )epartment of Labor sent one of their staff memers to the annual meeting of the Guild in Knox-file. She stayed in the region three weeks making TMENT 1940-41 an extensive study of the work and set-up of the important centers in which Guild members were located. She stayed four days in Gatlinburg and visited not only Arrowcraft but the other shops as well, as they would have to comply with the law if they are in Interstate Commerce. This would automatically eliminate the price competition with which we have always been faced locally. Because hand-loom weaving would be the most difficult handicraft to readjust, a committee representing the important weaving members of the Guild was appointed with myself as chairman, to make an exhaustive study of weaving that is done in the homes and paid by the piece. This study included not only the producing but the marketing of weaving. The committee met in Gatlinburg on April 18 with seven weaving centers represented. The report of their findings has not yet been sent to the Department of Labor as they are still working on some of the questions that were sent to them by the Department of Labor to be studied. At the present time nothing definite has been decided and the issue is still in the hands of the President of the Guild and the Department of Labor. The future selling prices of weaving are hard to predict with the uncertainty that is attached both to the advancing of the prices for materials and the probable application to handicrafts of the Wage and Hour Act. I have tried to safeguard as much as possible against the continuous advance in the price of materials by buying in quantity supplies of wool and linen before the rise took place. This is only a temporary advantage for as long as the war lasts, prices will continue to change. Wool has gone up recently and linen has already advanced over 100% with the supply uncertain. We have on hand enough staple linen to last us 8 to 12 more months and wool to last 6 to 8 months at our present rate of production with but few additional purchases. Cotton prices have not advanced materially as yet. This will necessarily mean increasing our selling prices on many of the woven articles and the cautious weaving of all our linens. It would help our weaving program tremendously this fall if the Clubs would not over-estimate the linens they will need for their sales and order on the hand-to-mouth plan. Everything that we do not have to weave will conserve our supply of materials that cannot be replaced at the prices we paid for them. I hesitate to overstock in face of the uncertain times ahead. Respectfully submitted, WINOGENE B. REDDING PRINCIPAL'S ANNUAL EPO T, 1940.41 1st' THE 1940-41 school year opened on Tuesday after Labor Day, with the brightest promise of very successful school year. The opening day's nrollment was the largest on record for the high chool, and both pupils and teachers seemed nxious to get down to work. The teaching staff was composed of: William wing, principal, History and Social Science; Ben qeming, Mathematics, Science, and Coach; Cleo Nelson, English and Librarian; William Coe, Vocational Agriculture; Charlotte Herman, Vocational Home Economics; and William Oakes, Vocational Handicrafts. Miss Nelson and Miss Herman, the new members of the staff, while lacking in experience, worked hard at the job and the high school ran along as smoothly as could be expected. The large enrollment made a longer school day THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 49 necessary as more classes had to be taught by the same teaching force. The school day was lengthened from six to eight periods, and the length of the periods changed from sixty to forty-five minutes. A new course in Biology was introduced for the sophomore class and Sociology was added for the seniors. The course of study this year consisted of: English, four units; Science, three units; History, and Social Science, four units; Mathematics, three units; Vocational Agriculture, three units; Vocational Home Economics, three units, and Handicrafts, one unit; a total of twenty-one classes daily. The high school enrollment showed a consider-able increase of the preceding year. This rate of increase will probably continue for two more years and then will level off, unless school busses are added to bring students from other communities.

They won thirteen games and lost JENNIE N][COL MEMO TWENTY years ago, the Jennie Nicol Memorial Health Center moved into the little white cottage that had been the home of the Andrew Ogle family. Through the years of service and friendly understanding, the few cases of the beginning years have grown to hundreds. Methods change as need arises, but the pioneers builded well, and the policies have changed but little. One of the most important phases of the work of the Health Center, is the care of the maternity cases. Twenty-six mothers were on the records for the year, most of whom were under the super-vision of some doctor. Advice on diet and exercise, lists and articles for layettes, preparation for home delivery or for hospitalization were given. Regular check of weight and general condition were kept as often as possible. Some of the new babies had regular nursing care for a few days, and some as well as older babies had formulas or diets regulated as necessary. Many of them have been in for the Friday after-noon clinics many times. One premature baby was fed with a medicine dropper for several days, until she was strong enough to nurse, and kept in a warmed basket in lieu of an incubator. One baby developed pneumonia, with supplementary infection, and lived but twenty-four hours, in spite of every treatment that could be suggested by the specialists in Knoxville. An oxygen tank was even borrowed from a service station and an inhalation mask devised from a paper sack, all to no avail. Henry, aged two and a half, and nearly blind from an attack of meningitis the year previous, one during the regular playing season, and went to the semi-finals in the district tournament. Four-teen players were awarded letters at the close of the season. The Settlement School staff put on the play "Who's Crazy Now" to a large and appreciative audience. The purpose of the play was to raise money for a moving picture machine for the school. The junior class presented a play in the fall and the senior class gave two plays to raise money for their trip to Washington. The trip of the senior class to the nation's capital, was one of the high lights of the school year for the seniors. They worked all year to make the necessary money for transportation. They had a five day trip, going to Washington by way of Natural Bridge and the Skyline Drive. They spent two days sightseeing in Washington and returned home by way of Yorktown, Norfolk, and Virginia Beach. The various clubs of the school had a very active year. The Home Economics club and the FFA furnished much of the social life of the school. The glee club under the direction of Mrs. Chalmers and Miss Nelson furnished the music for commencement. Dr. Stewart W. McClelland, President of , Lincoln Memorial University, delivered the commencement address, and Rev. W. D. Wilkinson preached the Baccalaureate sermon. Twenty seniors received their diplomas. Respectfully submitted, WILLIAM KING, Principal IAL HEALTH CENTE had an eye examination by Dr. Robert Leech of Knoxville. The child seems to do little more than distinguish light from darkness, and there seems little hope of any improvement. Probably at some later date, he may be placed in some school for some sort of training. Little red-headed Marjorie, whose left foot was straightened by Dr. Bagwell, is walking freely. Six months old Margaret has both tiny legs in casts for club foot correction. She is a patient of the Crippled Children's Clinic, and reports there on alternate Fridays for observation, change of cast or treatment. The Crippled Children's work is done under the auspices of the Sevier County Post of the American Legion, and by state funds. School inspections were held at intervals during the year at Gatlinburg, and at the six rural schools. Inoculations for typhoid, diphtheria, and small pox were made as necessary in each place. Talks pertaining to health were ,made in class rooms and in other meetings. The general health of the school children seems to be improving year by year. Fewer are underweight, due to supervised lunches, and increased knowledge of both parents and children. The Sevierville Lions Club has bought glasses for several children of the district, and r sorority aids in the correction of defects. A number of children had tonsils removed, a few had appendectomies, and many visited the dentist. There were innumerable dressings, a few fractures, and many sprains. But the high light of the school health program is the lessening of the old enemy, impetigo. Better living conditions, more balanced 10 \ 50 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW diet, and persistence of treatment, are undoubtedly responsible. Community nursing consists mostly of emergency or special treatment. Post-operative dressings, massage, hypodermics, irrigations, and instruction in home nursing. Several were taken to Cancer or Tuberculosis Clinics, and for X-rays. Three doctors in Sevierville have infirmaries, and rapid ambulance service has made it possible to transport patients quickly and safely. The Loan Closet continues to be of great service. Crutches, rubber sheeting, bed pans, hot water bottles, and ice caps are borrowed in case of need, and returned for the use of others. Night clothing for children and adults, and baby things are used again and again. As always, we are grateful for the cooperation met on every side, from the doctors who so freely give advice and aid, the members of the staff, and of the Fraternity. Above all, we are grateful for the friendship and appreciation of the people of the community. The work of the Health Center seems to go beyond mere physical needs. Worry and unhappiness are as tangible as disease, and a tonic for the ELEMENTA THE Ij[ B (1, Elementary School opened on September 3, 1940 with the following teachers: Eleanor Brabson, primer; Doris Hatch, first grade; Ruth Parker, second grade; Veryle Elder, third grade; Pauline Morris, fourth grade; Pauline Sharp, fifth grade; Flora Belle DeWitt, sixth and seventh grades ; C. Pern Price, eighth grade. For the seventh consecutive year the II B Elementary School has won the cup in the Blue Ribbon contest for the larger schools. This is quite a distinction as no other school in the county, large or small, can equal this record. For the second year the elementary school has been given a rating of 100% in the sanitation program. We are one of the twelve schools in the county to make this record. A number of books for our library were given to us by friends from Muncie, Indiana. Most all system no more necessary than a tonic for morale. It is our sincere hope that the Health Center may continue to stand for those things, whatever they may be, that will make life happier and more healthful for our people. Following is the summary of the work of the past year, in comparison with that of the pre ceding period. 1939 40 Class of Work 1940 41 Field visits 2,187 1,922 Office calls 2,283 2,349 Surgical dressings 2,002 2,106 Pupil inspections 2,165 2,140 Health talks 69 78 Diphtheria immunization 53 67 Schick tests 49 78 Small pox vacccinations 125 170 *Total typhoid shots 442 1,261 Completed typhoid series 269 400 Other inoculations 163 302 * New state ruling makes it possible to give but one Typhoid inoculation on alternate years after the initial series of three. MARJORIE CHALMERS, R.N. Y SCHOOL the books were fiction. On April 8, 1941, the faculty of the high school and elementary school gave a play, "Who's Crazy Now." In addition to the faculty Mrs. Snow and Miss Redding took part. The purpose of this play was to take the proceeds and apply on a 16 mm. motion picture machine for use of the school. The enrollment for 1940-41 was 285. The average daily attendance was 225. Inattendance, "flu" and other reasons kept this lower than it should have been. The elementary school had its first football team. Out of five games played they did not lose a game and had their goal line crossed only twice during the season. The largest eighth grade class to finish school in the elementary department finished this year. C. PERN PRICE HANDICRAFTS FoR my report I am giving you an exact list of the articles that were made by the high school group for the past year. There were fourteen in this group that finished this year. Five were seniors and nine juniors. There were five of this group who took other classes during this class period. Some few of them came in the afternoons to make some of this time up. I never had the entire group in the shop at the same time. I could not give the organized work that I should have given, because of this. There were some few that be-came quite skilled. If they could go on with this work, they could accomplish something. As it is they can't take another year because they have had two vocational credits and can have only four to graduate. This course gives two. All of the equipment is in first class order. There have been only a few tools lost. A handsaw, hammer, and a pair of side cutting pliers disappeared while the plumbers were here. Every member of the group this year made an article for the school, to be left here. Many thanks for the job and the many favors, Sincerely, WILLIAM O. OAKES HOME ECONOMICS DEPARTMENT ORTY-SEVEN girls were enrolled in Home five were freshmen, ten were sophomores, and FEconomks the largest number in the history twelve were juniors. The seniors were unable to of the Settlement School. Of this group, twentytake Home Economics as an elective because it THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 51 conflicted with their required courses. In the freshman class, the most popular units were those in clothing construction. The girls made simple blouses, skirts, and aprons in the fall to learn how to use the sewing machine and how to follow a commercial pattern. Some of the girls had sewed considerably at home so each girl chose a clothing problem according to her own skill level so that she could learn something new in her class project. At the end of the six weeks' unit in sewing, the class judged the dresses, and on this basis, two achievement awards were made. The awards were pins given by a commercial pattern company. The girls were very proud of their prizes. During the first semester, we also studied personal grooming, etiquette, and breakfast preparation and service. In October, the freshmen gave an afternoon tea for their mothers and the school staff. This was the climax of their study of manners, introductions, and the art of being a hostess. During the foods units the girls were divided into families for the purpose of working together in planning and preparing the food. Each family served a breakfast in early December, inviting one of the elementary school teachers as guest. In the second semester the freshmen studied child care and development, using their own brothers and sisters at home for observation; preparation and serving of luncheons; school lunches; and food for outdoor hikes and picnics. The sophomore class seemed to be most interested in the foods units. In our first unit food preservation, we canned tomatoes, and apple sauce, and made orange marmalade and apple jelly. As a result of this study, two of the girls made jelly for home projects. Awards similar to those the freshmen received were given the sophomores on the completion of their fall wool dresses. The weaving for the sophomores worked out very well this year because there was an even number of girls in the class so that each pair could work on one loom. Three of our six weeks were spent in making the warps and in setting up the looms for weaving. Each girl then wove a sampler, a towel, and a pillow top. While half the girls were weaving, the others were sewing on baby garments for the American Red Cross. Other units that the sophomores studied included: elements of nutrition, personal grooming, and luncheon preparation and service. 0 MITO THE year of 1940-41 has been a very busy one. As in any household, looking back, it is hard to say what has been accomplished. The culinary department has been taken care of by Belle Lowe and Mrs. Lurie Hurst, and the necessary upkeep such as mending, new curtains, helping the boys and girls, has fallen to me. Two of our girls left us in April to ride the bus to school, but I replaced them by another. The juniors were especially interested in individual development, so our year's work was planned along that line. The first semester they studied personality improvement, personal grooming, clothing budgets and wardrobes, and clothing construction. Two of the girls made wool suits, several made afternoon dresses, and the others made wool school dresses. One week was spent in the, study of vocations for girls. Nursing, office work, and elementary school teaching were especially interesting to the class. The second semester the juniors took up special party cookery, food and health, textiles, clothing construction, and outdoor cookery. At Christmas time, the sophomores planned the menu, decorated, and served the annual dinner for the faculty. The juniors were in charge of food preparation. This spring the juniors planned and prepared the food for the F.F.A. boys and their parents, and the freshmen and sophomores decorated and served. Ninety guests were served in the general science laboratory. Four girls went to the Open House at the University of Tennessee. One junior modelled a two-piece wool dress and a sophomore modelled a spring skirt and jerkin. In March, the juniors took a field trip to Knoxville to visit the furniture stores, after studying about the different types of furnishings suitable for their own homes. Each girl completed three home projects, in addition to her class work. Sewing seemed to be the most popular type of project. Among the projects were: quilts, baby and children's clothes, curtains, pillow cases, slip covers for chairs, and all types of clothes for the girls themselves. Some of the food projects were: baking; preparation of breakfasts, luncheons, and suppers; and a study of pastries. The Home Economics Club had fifty-five members this year. Bi-weekly meetings were held, with programs planned by the girls at each meeting. From November through March, the Home Economics teacher and the Agriculture teacher con-ducted a joint class for adult men and women at the Laurel Grove School in Wear's Valley. The classes met an hour and a half every two weeks. Among the topics discussed for women were: home gardens, menu planning, food and health, and canning. Respectfully submitted, CHARLOTTE HERMAN MS, 1940-41 I have bought five unfinished dressers for th, girls' dormitory and finished them, and had tit floor in the dining room sanded and waxed, an( with Mrs. Hagee's assistance bought a linoleun rug for "Miss Georgic's" room. I would recommend that the kitchen be painted and if it is possible that an electric mixer b purchased for the kitchen. Respectfully submitted, ANNETTE MORSE 5 2 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE ALL DAY CLASSES: This year's enrollment in this group reached a total of fifty-one boys. Three classes were taught in Vocational Agriculture. These classes consisted of twenty-five freshman boys, another class was made up of seventeen sophomores and still another consisted of eight iunior and senior boys. This year we had thirty-four of the fifty-one beginning boys to complete the entire school year. The remaining thirty-foul boys are at present conducting complete supervised Farming Programs. EVENING SCHOOL CLASSES: One night school was conducted in the Laurel Grove Community for those men who are established in the business of farming. This adult class I teach at least one night out of each month and this continues throughout the year. This year we had seventeen meetings with a total of fifty-three farmers enrolled. Our course of study is based on the needs of the community. We made surveys to determine what were the farming and living conditions of the Laurel Grove Community. After spending one class meeting in a discussion of our data, the farmers came to the conclusion that their greatest problem was low income. Farmers were then led to set up objectives which would increase their farm income. They were: 1. To increase soil fertility through (a) liming (b) phosphating (c) rotating crops (d) growing winter cover crops 2. To provide livestock of good type to consume all feed produced on the farm. 3. To produce the home food supply on the farm as nearly as possible. 4. To improve the farm home and its surroundings through (a) providing electric lights and running water in the home. (b) repairing the farm home. (c) improving the home grounds. PART-TIME CLASSES: This year one class was taught to a group of out-of-school boys at Camp Morgan, the CCC camp which is located five miles away from the school. I met with this group of thirty-two boys one night each week to study problems pertaining to farming. These boys as a group have three projects on the camp grounds: 1. Poultry 2. Bees 3. Rabbits On January 1 of this year, there came aid through the Sevier County Board of Education to provide National Defense Training for out-ofschool rural and urban youth. The supervision of these .classes became the job of the Vocational Agriculture Teachers throughout the State. Our School provided two of these classes to this group. One of these was taught by Mr. Walter Cardwell in woodworking, in which twenty-five boys were enrolled. The other class is now being taught at Pigeon Forge Elementary School House by Mr. Fred Cooper. This course is in elementary electricity, in which twenty students are enrolled. It is hoped that these boys will be better able to do the necessary jobs in preparation for war or in time of war. We have an improved Farm Shop as a result of this training. We now have $264.00 worth of additional equipment for our farm shop. We think this equipment will become the property of Sevier County Board of Education and this will be left with the Agricultural Department of our School. THE FFA CHAPTER: The Future Farmers of America chapter has completed a most successful year. We have taken part in the following outside activities of the School: 1. Showing Dairy Cattle at the County Fair. 2. Exhibiting Farm products, farmshop work, and poultry at the County Fair and at the Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial Fair at Knoxville. 3. Sponsored FFA and Home Economics socials. 4. Livestock and Dairy cattle judging contest at the University of Tennessee in which sixty-eight high school chapters of FFA competed. (Pi Phi won third place in Livestock and Roy McCarter, a senior FFA boy, was high point contestant of the whole contest in which 209 boys entered.) 5. Sponsored Third Annual Parent and Son Banquet. (FFA boys invited their mothers and fathers. Eighty-seven parents and guests attended.) 6. Public Speaking contest at University. (Roy Ogle, a senior FFA boy, placed second in the 5th district which had 14 chapters competing.) 7. FFA Baseball and Basketball teams. 8. Presentation of the FFA cup to best All-around high school girl. 9. Two boys continue to produce Hybrid corn for seed. Last year one boy sold $224.00 worth of seed corn harvested from one acre. 10. Four town boys who are taking agriculture have rented land from the airport and have what appears to be successful Home Gar-dens. Some of these boys have in addition, Home Improvement, and twenty-five to fifty chicks for broilers. 11. CAMP CLEMENTS Five boys and I at-tended the Tennessee FFA camp for one week last summer. (Pi Phi won the athletic award for that week's activities.) 12. FFA field day, the last Saturday in April, found us competing in field meets at Powell Station High School, Knox County, with FFA chapters of the 5th district. The boys did well in the events, but their total points were not enough to surpass the Powell Station FFA. 13. RADIO PROGRAMS. This year the Pi Beta Phi FFA sponsored two programs over WNOX. The first program was presented by four boys who were growing Hybrid corn for seed. The Title of the program was GROWING HYBRID CORN. Our second program was entitled THE AGRICULTURAL CONDITION OF SEVIER . COUNTY AND HOW THE VOCATION-AL AGRICULTURE AT PI BETA PHI PLAYS ITS PART. This program was given by four senior FFA boys. 14. Tennessee FFA Convention was attended THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 53 by five boys and myself in Memphis, Tennessee, April 25 and 26. Our chapter was presented with the camp award, mentioned as a third place winner of the Livestock Judging contest and also that Roy McCarter from II B (1) had made the highest number of points of any boy in the East Tennessee Livestock judging contest. Dot Fox, a junior, and also a Hybrid Corn Grower, was awarded the degree of the Tennessee State planter. Dot plans to try to become an American farmer within the next two years. The fifth district of FFA offered three money awards to the best supervised farming program conducted by a boy last year. Dot won the second prize and the first prize went to a University of Tennessee Freshman boy of the college of agriculture. THE SCHOOL FARM: This year we had eight boys in the Dormitory who did the work on the farm and janitor work in the school houses. Six of these boys took Vocational Agriculture. They were given charge of certain enterprises in which they were responsible in their work. This causes the boy to take more interest in his work and thus a better job is done. Last fall our Jerseys, poultry, hogs, and farm products placed well at our County Fair. We had the Grand Champion animal of the Jersey Show. This year we have 140 white Leghorn hens in our laying flock. 100 white Leghorn sexed baby chicks were bought for replacements in the laying flock next fall. 800 baby chicks were bought and fed to broiler weight for Dining hall and to sell to the hotel. Mountain View Hotel uses all of our extra broilers which we produce and gives us a good price for them. Two modern brooder houses were constructed on the farm by agriculture boys as a part of their training in Agriculture. A water line was laid from the Boys' Dormitory to the incubator house. This makes it possible for us to provide ample water for livestock at the barn without having to carry it. As to the financial standing of the farm I pre-sent the following: Month Sold to Farm Farm Kitchen Expense Receipts July $ 229.09 $ 6.95 $ 37.93 August 194.36 412.23 4.00 September 145.69 80.71 2.00 October 205.49 152.68 23.35 November 145.25 273.76 36.16 December 141.01 254.62 19.00 January 157.52 3.88 64.48 February 150.05 273.92 72.10 March 264.51 90.22 April 236.69 155.81 27.63 May 175.20 336.78 247.62 Total $2,044.86 $2,052.45 $534.27 Sold to kitchen plus cash income $2,579.13 Total income less expenses 526.68 ).

Three of our six weeks were spent in making the warps and in setting up the looms for weaving. Each girl then wove a sampler, a towel, and a pillow top. While half the girls were weaving, the others were sewing on baby garments for the American Red Cross. Other units that the sophomores studied included: elements of nutrition, personal grooming, and luncheon preparation and service. 0 MITO THE year of 1940-41 has been a very busy one. As in any household, looking back, it is hard to say what has been accomplished. The culinary department has been taken care of by Belle Lowe and Mrs. Lurie Hurst, and the necessary upkeep such as mending, new curtains, helping the boys and girls, has fallen to me. Two of our girls left us in April to ride the bus to school, but I replaced them by another. The juniors were especially interested in individual development, so our year's work was planned along that line. The first semester they studied personality improvement, personal grooming, clothing budgets and wardrobes, and clothing construction. Two of the girls made wool suits, several made afternoon dresses, and the others made wool school dresses. One week was spent in the, study of vocations for girls. Nursing, office work, and elementary school teaching were especially interesting to the class. The second semester the juniors took up special party cookery, food and health, textiles, clothing construction, and outdoor cookery. At Christmas time, the sophomores planned the menu, decorated, and served the annual dinner for the faculty. The juniors were in charge of food preparation. This spring the juniors planned and prepared the food for the F.F.A. boys and their parents, and the freshmen and sophomores decorated and served. Ninety guests were served in the general science laboratory. Four girls went to the Open House at the University of Tennessee. One junior modelled a two-piece wool dress and a sophomore modelled a spring skirt and jerkin. In March, the juniors took a field trip to Knoxville to visit the furniture stores, after studying about the different types of furnishings suitable for their own homes. Each girl completed three home projects, in addition to her class work. Sewing seemed to be the most popular type of project. Among the projects were: quilts, baby and children's clothes, curtains, pillow cases, slip covers for chairs, and all types of clothes for the girls themselves. Some of the food projects were: baking; preparation of breakfasts, luncheons, and suppers; and a study of pastries. The Home Economics Club had fifty-five members this year. Bi-weekly meetings were held, with programs planned by the girls at each meeting. From November through March, the Home Economics teacher and the Agriculture teacher con-ducted a joint class for adult men and women at the Laurel Grove School in Wear's Valley. The classes met an hour and a half every two weeks. Among the topics discussed for women were: home gardens, menu planning, food and health, and canning. Respectfully submitted, CHARLOTTE HERMAN MS, 1940-41 I have bought five unfinished dressers for th, girls' dormitory and finished them, and had tit floor in the dining room sanded and waxed, an( with Mrs. Hagee's assistance bought a linoleun rug for "Miss Georgic's" room. I would recommend that the kitchen be painted and if it is possible that an electric mixer b purchased for the kitchen. Respectfully submitted, ANNETTE MORSE 5 2 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE ALL DAY CLASSES: This year's enrollment in this group reached a total of fifty-one boys. Three classes were taught in Vocational Agriculture. These classes consisted of twenty-five freshman boys, another class was made up of seventeen sophomores and still another consisted of eight iunior and senior boys. This year we had thirty-four of the fifty-one beginning boys to complete the entire school year. The remaining thirty-foul boys are at present conducting complete supervised Farming Programs. EVENING SCHOOL CLASSES: One night school was conducted in the Laurel Grove Community for those men who are established in the business of farming. This adult class I teach at least one night out of each month and this continues throughout the year. This year we had seventeen meetings with a total of fifty-three farmers enrolled. Our course of study is based on the needs of the community. We made surveys to determine what were the farming and living conditions of the Laurel Grove Community. After spending one class meeting in a discussion of our data, the farmers came to the conclusion that their greatest problem was low income. Farmers were then led to set up objectives which would increase their farm income. They were: 1. To increase soil fertility through (a) liming (b) phosphating (c) rotating crops (d) growing winter cover crops 2. To provide livestock of good type to consume all feed produced on the farm. 3. To produce the home food supply on the farm as nearly as possible. 4. To improve the farm home and its surroundings through (a) providing electric lights and running water in the home. (b) repairing the farm home. (c) improving the home grounds. PART-TIME CLASSES: This year one class was taught to a group of out-of-school boys at Camp Morgan, the CCC camp which is located five miles away from the school. I met with this group of thirty-two boys one night each week to study problems pertaining to farming. These boys as a group have three projects on the camp grounds: 1. Poultry 2. Bees 3. Rabbits On January 1 of this year, there came aid through the Sevier County Board of Education to provide National Defense Training for out-ofschool rural and urban youth. The supervision of these .classes became the job of the Vocational Agriculture Teachers throughout the State. Our School provided two of these classes to this group. One of these was taught by Mr. Walter Cardwell in woodworking, in which twenty-five boys were enrolled. The other class is now being taught at Pigeon Forge Elementary School House by Mr. Fred Cooper. This course is in elementary electricity, in which twenty students are enrolled. It is hoped that these boys will be better able to do the necessary jobs in preparation for war or in time of war. We have an improved Farm Shop as a result of this training. We now have $264.00 worth of additional equipment for our farm shop. We think this equipment will become the property of Sevier County Board of Education and this will be left with the Agricultural Department of our School. THE FFA CHAPTER: The Future Farmers of America chapter has completed a most successful year. We have taken part in the following outside activities of the School: 1. Showing Dairy Cattle at the County Fair. 2. Exhibiting Farm products, farmshop work, and poultry at the County Fair and at the Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial Fair at Knoxville. 3. Sponsored FFA and Home Economics socials. 4. Livestock and Dairy cattle judging contest at the University of Tennessee in which sixty-eight high school chapters of FFA competed. (Pi Phi won third place in Livestock and Roy McCarter, a senior FFA boy, was high point contestant of the whole contest in which 209 boys entered.) 5. Sponsored Third Annual Parent and Son Banquet. (FFA boys invited their mothers and fathers. Eighty-seven parents and guests attended.) 6. Public Speaking contest at University. (Roy Ogle, a senior FFA boy, placed second in the 5th district which had 14 chapters competing.) 7. FFA Baseball and Basketball teams. 8. Presentation of the FFA cup to best All-around high school girl. 9. Two boys continue to produce Hybrid corn for seed. Last year one boy sold $224.00 worth of seed corn harvested from one acre. 10. Four town boys who are taking agriculture have rented land from the airport and have what appears to be successful Home Gar-dens. Some of these boys have in addition, Home Improvement, and twenty-five to fifty chicks for broilers. 11. CAMP CLEMENTS Five boys and I at-tended the Tennessee FFA camp for one week last summer. (Pi Phi won the athletic award for that week's activities.) 12. FFA field day, the last Saturday in April, found us competing in field meets at Powell Station High School, Knox County, with FFA chapters of the 5th district. The boys did well in the events, but their total points were not enough to surpass the Powell Station FFA. 13. RADIO PROGRAMS. This year the Pi Beta Phi FFA sponsored two programs over WNOX. The first program was presented by four boys who were growing Hybrid corn for seed. The Title of the program was GROWING HYBRID CORN. Our second program was entitled THE AGRICULTURAL CONDITION OF SEVIER . COUNTY AND HOW THE VOCATION-AL AGRICULTURE AT PI BETA PHI PLAYS ITS PART. This program was given by four senior FFA boys. 14. Tennessee FFA Convention was attended THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 53 by five boys and myself in Memphis, Tennessee, April 25 and 26. Our chapter was presented with the camp award, mentioned as a third place winner of the Livestock Judging contest and also that Roy McCarter from II B (1) had made the highest number of points of any boy in the East Tennessee Livestock judging contest. Dot Fox, a junior, and also a Hybrid Corn Grower, was awarded the degree of the Tennessee State planter. Dot plans to try to become an American farmer within the next two years. The fifth district of FFA offered three money awards to the best supervised farming program conducted by a boy last year. Dot won the second prize and the first prize went to a University of Tennessee Freshman boy of the college of agriculture. THE SCHOOL FARM: This year we had eight boys in the Dormitory who did the work on the farm and janitor work in the school houses. Six of these boys took Vocational Agriculture. They were given charge of certain enterprises in which they were responsible in their work. This causes the boy to take more interest in his work and thus a better job is done. Last fall our Jerseys, poultry, hogs, and farm products placed well at our County Fair. We had the Grand Champion animal of the Jersey Show. This year we have 140 white Leghorn hens in our laying flock. 100 white Leghorn sexed baby chicks were bought for replacements in the laying flock next fall. 800 baby chicks were bought and fed to broiler weight for Dining hall and to sell to the hotel. Mountain View Hotel uses all of our extra broilers which we produce and gives us a good price for them. Two modern brooder houses were constructed on the farm by agriculture boys as a part of their training in Agriculture. A water line was laid from the Boys' Dormitory to the incubator house. This makes it possible for us to provide ample water for livestock at the barn without having to carry it. As to the financial standing of the farm I pre-sent the following: Month Sold to Farm Farm Kitchen Expense Receipts July $ 229.09 $ 6.95 $ 37.93 August 194.36 412.23 4.00 September 145.69 80.71 2.00 October 205.49 152.68 23.35 November 145.25 273.76 36.16 December 141.01 254.62 19.00 January 157.52 3.88 64.48 February 150.05 273.92 72.10 March 264.51 90.22 April 236.69 155.81 27.63 May 175.20 336.78 247.62 Total $2,044.86 $2,052.45 $534.27 Sold to kitchen plus cash income $2,579.13 Total income less expenses 526.68 ).

SATISFACTION in a glorious Settlement School past and recognition of a needed and constructive present program, is not enough for a deter-mined, intelligent organization. For an answer to all your questions regarding the wise direction of our Settlement School welfare program, watch for an authoritative analysis in your December ARROW. We are proud of our success. We are not ashamed of our failures. It took both to build the substantial contribution to human betterment that Pi Phi Settlement School now represents. In the heart of every Pi Phi is the wish to preserve the qualities of service that we cherish most, a unified effort to raise the level of an entire community, an effort which in turn reacts to the perpetuation or Pi Phi ideals, Pi Phi strength, Pi Phi's growth. Throughout the ages, the trial and error method has prevailed as a basic test of separating truth from falsehood. It is indeed a tribute to Pi Phi's sound principles and wise planning that the success of our pioneer aims has had so few interruptions and so few detours as community need was measured. Changes in the application of our program, if wisely planned and executed, should cause no disruption to a smooth-running community service. We have moved so gradually into ever widening fields that both Pi Phi and the community have scarcely been aware of the transitions of the past thirty-two years. Today, news of the definite relinquishment to the County of further responsibility of the first six grades of the elementary school will create no community unrest, and will be welcomed by the conscientious far-seeing members of the community, for it has always been their desire to accept their own responsibilities when possible. Satisfaction will be felt by those progressive Pi Phis who for some years have agreed that we should relinquish this field. Our brain child has grown up; we must give it responsibility and let it try its own wings to prove whether our guidance has been true or false. There is agreement among even the most sentimental and conservative alumnae whose reluctance to give up this department has been based upon the understandable desire to preserve the intimate influence in the homes that this elementary school work has allowed. With mingled emotions of satisfaction and regret, Pi Phi will accept the news that official written notification has been given to the SEVIER COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD that we will with-draw assistance in the first six grades at the close of school 1943 as a natural outcome of a service well planned a proof that we have made progress in our aim to make our community self-supporting. This step is insurance that we May concentrate upon obligations that have been' increasing rather than diminishing. Growing population, education, and economic advancement, combine in challenging Pi Phis to redouble their efforts as the self-elected sponsor of an entire community. Can we stand success? Are we big enough to enlarge our perspective? To you, loyal Pi Phis, who have enjoyed hard work together and felt the thrill of satisfaction in seeing far-reaching results, we are sure that you are ready to face the conditions resulting from your sacrifice and labor. We are sure that you wish to capitalize upon your investment. We know that you wish to increase the dividends by renewed effort to build for the future upon foundations so strong and sturdy, keeping alive roots ,so deep and far-reaching. Every Pi Phi has a valued opinion, a personal and sincere desire. The sum total of 33,000 desires will determine the trend of our future service. The value of unified national effort has been so well demonstrated that there is a unanimous will to pre-serve strength through a centralized service. End-less are the channels through which we could give needed service. Almost any unselfish impulse and personal choice would result in constructive effort. It is a recognized fact that our foundations in the Smokies are so deep, our material plant and resources so adequate and flexible, the location so desirable, that Pi Phi can adapt this setup to any use determined by changing need and Pi Phi national viewpoint. Every Pi Phi admits proudly that we have not been standing still. Your committee admits confidently that there is need of the present service with its administration in line with currently suggested improvements. In addition to a serious consideration of the present, your committees have been struggling for years to keep ahead of the times in anticipation of future needs. While you worked and your committees interpreted your wishes in administering the details of a progressively sound service, there has been laid quietly a foundation. The pattern has been set for a coming broader achievement. Just when and how and why this pattern evolved itself into a certain compelling groove, we do not attempt to explain. Firm in the minds of those close to the situation, is the conviction that a greater opportunity lies ahead for Pi Phi, if we will heed the suggestions of this pattern. It is not news that your committee sees the future of our children. our youth and adults, in terms of planting the seeds and nourishing the development of an appreciation of form, color and design. We see for this reason a future of individual and collective opportunity to maintain themselves in ever-growing dignity by means of production of handicrafts of a superior quality. These products must be acceptable to the discriminating traveling public brought to this region by the lavish gifts of nature and the miracle of good roads. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW By supplying an ever-widening field in vocai.onal guidance, based upon an awakening to ,eauty of form and color, a whole community can ;radually make for itself a national center for de-.elopment of arts and crafts. Before interpreting too fully in terms of commitee deductions, we want you to know of a plan hat has been under way for years to compile factual roof of the humanitarian and educational value of hese tangible and intangible trends. Your committees have made every possible tudy preliminary to a factual survey from outide, unbiased, non Pi Phi authorities. You will understand our wish to have verificaion of or proof against certain trends; a desire or professional and experienced advice as to the .pplication of Pi Phi welfare service, not only in terms of need but in terms of whether the need justifies Pi Phi aid. You will welcome with us the authoritative and comprehensive survey regarding the soundness of the claim of a persistently challenging opportunity to expand our influence and create a new and satisfying future for the people of the Appalachian Mountains. Look for word of this in the December ARROW. Your committee welcomes and invites your suggestions, your opinions and your heartfelt wishes. Mutual enjoyment in sharing a great responsibility has given us a past of which we are proud. Mutual agreement and determination will build for us a happy future of greater service. ETHEL H. Cop?, Chairman Settlement School Committee. 'HUME OF SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE MEETING, 1941 THE MEMBERS of the II B 1 Settlement School Committee met for the annual meeting at the ,ettlement School from June 20 to June 28, 1941, vith three sessions a day. After an official welcome, specially of the new members, Agnes Spring and .olita Prouty, by Ethel Copp, the assignment of uties followed: Chairman, Ethel Copp. Treasurer, Irene Eldridge. Secretary Ways and Means, Lolita Prouty. Films and Publicity, Beth Le Roy. News from Little Pigeon, Agnes Spring. The Manual and the minutes of the 1940 meetig were read, followed by reports and recomiendations of committee and staff members. All !commendations were discussed and considered. Besides administrative problems, the Committee ttempted a survey of the community as to what :ley think of our project, and also a survey of the eeds of the community in regard to our future olicy. Marie Hagee, chairman for the past year, ras able to be present ex-officio at the request of to Committee with her invaluable assistance for lost of the sessions. Amy B. Onken, the Contactrith-Grand-Council-Member of the Committee for to year 1940-41, added her wealth of experience ad information for four days, during two of rhich all of Grand Council met with the Cornlittee. Among matters discussed with Grand Council ere: 1. A tentative physical plan of our development including discussions of: a. The giving over of the elementary school to the county. b. The new Stuart Cottage. c. A new Health Center. d. A new water system. e. A new gymnasium. 2. A discussion of the Wages and Hours Act. Miss Winogene Redding, weaving super-visor, reported on this and how it may affect our Arrowcraft industry if hand-loom weaving is not given exemption. 3. A consideration of the recommendations made by the Committee. The Committee felt it a special privilege to have le opportunity of personal discussion with Grand Council and hopes that it may serve the Fraternity more efficiently in the solution of the future trend of our project because of the exchange and comparison of ideas. Both the Committee and Grand Council felt we should know whether we are doing the right thing at the Settlement School and if not, what we should be doing, so definite plans were made for obtaining professional advice for the continued survey of needs and future trends of the Settlement School project. It was agreed to relinquish the first six years of the Elementary School to the County at the end of the school year 1942-43. In the discussion of this motion it was brought out that the County is able now to take over the School and at the present time has been paying us $125.00 a month for rent of the building and all the salaries of the elementary teachers. Since our building and equipment is becoming obsolete it would be necessary to build a new building if we kept the school much longer. The contracts were let for the construction, heating, wiring, and plumbing of the new Stuart Building at a cost of $8,600.00. A new Crafts teacher was hired, and special emphasis is to be put on that phase of work next year. An effort was made to secure a music teacher through the University of Tennessee and the W.P.A. music director by supplementing the salary of someone recommended by them. Among motions passed dealing with other matters were: That the discount allowed to alumni clubs on Arrowcraft orders be increased from 15 per cent to 20 per cent. That a safe reserve of Arrowcraft funds be maintained for Arrowcraft use. That the entire cost of the new boys' dormitory including the architect's fees be kept within the bequest of Anne Stuart, i.e., $9,200.00. That Bigridge and McCookville schools be turned back to the County for health supervision if after a conference with County officials, the Chairman thinks is advisable. That the budget for publicity be increased in order that the publicity chairman be enabled to prepare a set of scrap books for fraternity circulation and other new publicity measures. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 35 That Pollard Cottage be renovated. That the writing of the name Arrowcraft be made to conform to that as registered in the patent office, i.e., one word. That a new film of the welfare phase of our work be done in color. That the Director plan for the furnishings of the Stuart Cottage and as soon as possible submit an estimate. That some adequate fire protection be installed immediately, according to plan and advice of the County Sanitary Director and subject to approval of the Committee and Grand Council. That some of the money given as gifts last year be used to purchase a movie projector if laws permit its use in the high school building. That the steps to the Health Center be rebuilt and the surgical dressing room be painted. That $100.00 be allowed to obtain a new bull in exchange for the old, and $150.00 allowed to purchase a new horse. That a second rest room of the Arrowcraft Shop be equipped. That the addition of a bag for the nurse and a small refrigerator for serums to the equipment of the Health Center be approved, deferring the purchase in the hope that they may be obtained as gifts. That a concrete walk be built across the pasture from Pollard Cottage to the Health Center. That new showers be built for the gymnasium if after further study it seems advisable. Signed, LOLITA S. PROUTY, Secretary. EPO T OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE e\.7THER year brings another report of the 1progress and expansion of our Settlement School. We Pi Phis who, by our sustained interest and support have made such development possible, have reason to grow more proud of our project. It has become in these twenty-eight years a philanthropy which is unique among both men's and women's fraternities. When delegates from the regional Panhellenic conference at Knoxville visited the school last fall, they voiced amazement at the scope of our undertaking, and whole-hearted approval. Many remarked on the enviable position it gave us in comparison to other organizations. Through its Chairman, the Settlement School committee makes an annual report of its steward-ship, giving to the Fraternity a present-day picture of the school, with its changes, expansion, and policies. As always, any discussion of the school falls into certain divisions, which are in general, the school elementary and high school health department, buildings, and Arrowcraft. This has been a year of changes, but the one of most concern to all of us came in March, when our well-loved Director, Mrs. Eunice Weaver, had to re-sign because of illness. Her leaving was regretted by committee, staff and townspeople alike, for all felt a deep affection for her. In her seven years as director, she had established herself firmly in the life of the school and community, through her fine sense of responsibility, her pleasant responsiveness to all, and her ability to cope with any difficulties which arose, We shall miss her more than can be expressed. The grade and high school have been well-staffed this year, with Mr. King, our able super-intendant as the head. Charlotte Herman, Illinois Z, in charge of the home-economics department, has built up and maintained interest in her program for the high school girls. She has also worked with the adult women. William Coe has again handled efficiently the vocational agriculture, con-ducting both adult and student classes. Cleo Nelson, North' Dakota Alpha, has been in charge of English classes and the library. Of these only Charlotte Herman will return next year, as Mr. King feels that he must give his undivided attention to the renting of his tourist cabins, and Cleo Nelson is taking a business position. We shall miss Mr. King tremendously, as in his eleven years with us we have learned to rely on his loyalty, good judgment, and efficiency. How-ever, we hope that, since he is to remain in Gatlinburg, we shall be able to count on his continued interest, and help in emergencies. Cleo Nelson has been well-liked and we regret to have to replace her, but we know our new Pi Phi from Kansas B, Miriam Moore, will prove as valuable. After two years as head of the new course in wood and metal crafts, William Oakes is being replaced, since we hope to make changes in the course which will demand a teacher of different capability and training. You all know, of course, that the elementary school is entirely supported by the county, but is under our supervision. After having the teachers recommended by us, the county board elects them, half to be Pi Phis and half to be county girls. The school will remain under the direction of C. Perm Price who continues his untiring efforts that the grade A rating given ,by the state last year may be retained. Our Pi Phi teachers this year all doing splendid work have been Ruth Parker, whom we were delighted to have return unexpectedly to us this year for her third year of service; Pauline Morris, New York A; Florabelle DeWitt, Colorado B; and Doris Hatch, Illinois A. Three county girls, Pauline Sharp, Veryl Elder, and Eleanor Brabson will return next year to continue their successful work. Our high school enrollment increased so greatly this year, that the freshman classes in some studies were too large to conform to the state requirements. Therefore, for this coming year we shall' be allowed an extra teacher. We have every reason to be proud of our school program in which minds and bodies have been successfully developed. We hope that handicraft can take an increasingly important place in the lives of boys and girls while they are at our school, and we are laying plans to bring this about, In my five years on the committee, I have heard repeated discussions of the necessity of adding courses in art and music. I think that this year may see our plans take definite form in putting these in the school curriculum. After visiting classes on my trips to the school, and seeing the vivid interest displayed by pupils in their studies, 3 6 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW I feel that if we give additional opportunities to these children, they will be eagerly seized. Besides this, if we are to market handicraft of these mountain people, we should give the children some training in color and line, so that as they grow older they may develop their sense of the beautiful and fitting, and produce increasingly fine work. To speak of the school brings up necessarily the health work which is done with the pupils. We have always tried to educate both adults and children along sanitary and health lines, and through inoculations and clinics we have brought up the standard of living in the community until we have practically eliminated such diseases as hookworm, typhoid, and even diphtheria. Marjorie Chalmers, R.N., as head of this department for the past five years, has been not only efficient, but sympathetic and understanding. The county is able to furnish little but serums, so in reality we supply a county nurse. Her days are always full, but when an epidemic of flu strikes the community, we wonder at the number of her calls each day. The question of sanitation in the village and outlying districts is an increasingly urgent one since tourists have flocked into the town, and at present there is always potential danger of an epidemic if there happens to be a long dry spell. Town waterworks are a necessity if this is to be avoided. The group of buildings on our hundred acres vary in age from the old one, housing arts and crafts, to the gracious new Arrowcraft shop, and as their age varies, their need of repairs, and maintenance varies. The older buildings require an increasingly greater amount in the budget for repairs and improvements, while of course, the newer ones demand less. The "budget" how brief the word looks, but what hours of study it exacts from the committee at their annual meeting! Donations are uncertain always, but needs remain constant or increase. This year our receipts from clubs and chapters will fall below what we counted upon, and we are thankful that magazine subscriptions have sold so well. Under Beatrice Purdunn's capable direction, the magazine agency shows an increased profit of $865 over last year. This year we are adding to our buildings, through the generosity of Anne Stuart, Nebraska )3, who left a bequest of $10,000, a new Stuart Cottage for use as a boys' dormitory. Barber and McMurray, the architects of our attractive new Arrowcraft shop, have drawn plans for a modern, two-story structure which can accommodate eight boys and two teachers, to replace the old frame dormitory. Two other Pi Phis have been generous, too, in naming the Settlement School as beneficiary in their wills: Mary Rosestengell Ross, Wisconsin A, from whose estate we will receive approximately $370, and Sue Graham Walsh, Colorado A, whose bequest will amount to about $320. The committee will decide at their meeting this June just how this money can best be used, since neither donor specified to what purpose it should be put, but we are indeed grateful for having the school re-membered. In charge of the buildings which house the sixteen dormitory students, and superintending them in their work about the place, is Miss Annette Morse, Illinois A. Her duties are various, but in spite of the demands on her time, she has managed to add to the furnishings and build up the supply of bedding by her thrifty mending and wise expenditure. Arrowcraft continues to be a successful business. So many Settlement School chairmen have reported how and why it has developed, that I shall not go into its past history. Two factors have contributed largely to its success. One of these is theunforeseen chance which opened one of the most popular of the national parks at our front door, and the other the wise selection as Director of Arrowcraft, Mrs. Ethel Weaver Snow, Iowa For the past seven years, by the sound business judgment, and able handling of her department, she has caused Arrowcraft to maintain a steady development. The volume of business has increased from year to year, due in part to the tourist trade, but also to a great extent because of our club sales. We have two shops in Gatlinburg, one under the supervision of Mrs. Snow, and the other in the Mountain View Hotel managed by Mrs. Georgia Duffield who, as has been said before, sells II B 1 with every article. "Miss Georgia" is noteworthy, also for her church and community interest. Our weaving supervisor, Winogene Redding, has contributed to the development of the business, through her wise buying of raw materials, appealing design of the woven articles, and tactful management of her ninety-five weavers. Nor ought to be overlooked the part which those efficient and attractive local girls, Edna and Bess McCarter, and Lura Oweneby, play in building up Arrowcraft. The first year in our new building shows the wisdom of our venture, for this year's sales have set a high level for all time. Beautifully designed, it attracts the eye of all tourists. A problem which has arisen this year and which holds serious potential difficulty for us, is the revision of the present Wage and Hour Act to include a code for workers weaving in their own homes. All members of the different weaving guilds will be affected by any increase in scale of pay, so, after an investigator of the Labor Department had visited the various shops, they decided to unite in furnishing correct information and statistics, in hope that such a radical increase might not he written into the law as to put them out of business. At the meeting of the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild, our Gene Redding was chosen to represent them in Washington, if need occurs, to appear at hearings there. Of course, there has been a great deal of correspondence on this matter, but all sent out by us has been submitted to the Fraternity's lawyers for their approval. No definite action has been taken as yet by the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor, and we hope that the matter can be adjusted satisfactorily without jeopardizing our Gatlinburg industry. In the emergency caused by the illness of Mrs. Weaver and her subsequent resignation, the whole staff carried on nobly. It was thought best by the committee to place temporarily in charge of the management of the school, the heads of the three departments: Mrs. Snow of Arrowcraft, Mrs. Chalmers of the health department, and Miss Annette Morse, our house manager and house mother. With Mrs. Snow as chairman, this group of three has had to deal with the problems which arose. In view of the critical situation, it was voted that I should make a special visit in April after Mrs. Weaver left, and give such advice and aid as I THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 37 could to help them organize the work. After spending a week there, I left with the comfortable assurance that everyone was doing her best to keep the school running as usual. Later in May we were fortunate enough to have the former Chair-man of the Settlement School Committee, Lillian Beck Holton, spend a week there as she returned from the Gamma Province Conference in South Carolina. Her calm judgment and excellent advice was never more valued than in this time of stress at the school. We of the Committee appreciated greatly her taking the time and trouble to make the visit. There have been changes in our staff other than in replacing the Director. Our competent and versatile bookkeeper, Frances Brown, Missouri r, resigned after three years of able service at the school. She is being replaced temporarily by Miss Alice Kiburtz, but we still have to find a II 13 cl, accountant who can fill the position. We have in the past few days voted to put in as Director of the School, Mrs. Elizabeth Comstock Peck, California B, whom we feel is well able to fill the position. Having not only been a business woman, but also a housekeeper and mother, she will doubtless be capable of dealing with the diverse problems which arise at the school. She arrives to take her new position early in June, and we feel sure that her pleasant personality and efficient training will make her a most capable Director. This year there are also changes on the Settlement School Committee, two of us rounding out our terms of five years. Jeffries Green Pace, who has furnished the interesting material for "News from Little Pigeon," is retiring this year, as am I. We both voice a great sadness at completing our term of office. However, the three members who are going on with the work make a most competent nucleus for the new board. Ethel Hogan Copp, California Gamma, who has been our secretary, will be the new chairman, and being five feet of dynamic energy, she will carry on the school management most successfully. Irene Eldridge, Wisconsin B, continues as treasurer, taking charge of all donations from Pi Phis, checking the work of the bookkeeper at the school, and in short, supervising all the financial affairs of the school. Beth Brainerd Le Roy, Massachusetts A, has been in charge of publicity and the routing of the films this year. We have kept in constant touch with each other by correspondence and sometimes telegraph, discussing the problems which have arisen since our annual meeting last July. As Chairman of the Committee, I made the usual winter visit to the school to see that the recommendations made by the committee were being carried out, and that the budget was being followed. At this time I, of course, had no idea that a second trip would be necessary. In being chairman of a standing committee, I have been delighted to see how efficiently the work of the Fraternity at large is being carried on. Although the contact member of the committee is the Grand President, I have found that all members of Grand Council have taken a great interest in the work of the school. In the beginning of this report, I spoke of the changes, expansion, and policies in the school. We have now come to consideration of these latter, present and future. Each year at the Committee meeting we pause to consider seriously how the school is developing, that we may make our actions in the right direction. Not only does the welfare of the community have to be considered, but also the wishes of all Pi Phis. When we are in Gatlinburg, listening to reports and informal discussions by staff and townspeople, it is a far simpler thing to know how they feel than to entertain your thoughts and desires about the school. Pi Phis bring back varying reports, according to the extent of their contacts during their stay. One of them may speed in over the highway, reach a hotel at nightfall, after dinner walk up the Neon-lighted main street to our Arrowcraft shop where she examines the stock with interest and asks some questions about the school and town, then leaves early the next morning. Another, however, comes for a stay of a day or two, in which time she makes a leisurely tour of the whole school plant, takes a hike or horseback trip over the mountain trails into the sparsely settled districts just outside of the Burg, and talks to everyone she meets. Each of these receives different impressions of the life and needs of the community, and their re-ports conflict. Some of these visitors have questioned the advisability of our continuing our work in the face of the growing sophistication of Gatlinburg, and to these I replied in the May ARROW. Because the needs reached by us have changed in character does not lessen their importance or number or our responsibility. The future of the school, like the future of many other things in our changing world, does not stretch clearly before us. The wisdom of curtailment or expansion, of shifts in curriculum, or of changes in policy, has to be reached after much discussion and investigation in committee meeting, and after all, may not prove to be wisdom. In the year intervening between meetings, trends may alter the whole school picture, as they reflect state and national changes. Decisions may be made which are impossible to carry out, or greatly delayed in putting into effect. For instance, it was agreed, in keeping with our desire to let these mountain people assume responsibility as their ability to do so increases, that the community would soon be able to house their elementary school instead of using our building and paying us rent as it has done heretofore. However, we find this will take time, as the process of transference is an involved one, necessitating adoption by the town of a resolution to erect a building, appearance before the legislature in their biannual meeting to get permission to float a bond issue, and ability to sell those bonds. So, in ending this 1941 report, I wish to ask as all chairmen before me have asked your continued support of our school, not only financially but in enthusiastic interest and sympathetic understanding. The tributes paid to our philanthropy by outsiders should give us fine assurance as to its lasting value as a memorial to our Founders. Respectfully submitted, MARIE B.

EAR MESDAMES: We have examined the records maintained by e Treasurer of your Committee for the Pi !ta Phi Settlement School for the fiscal year Lded June 30, 1941. With the data drawn DM these records we have combined the report .epared by Homer K. Jones and Company, pub-: accountants, from the subsidiary records kept / the School and its Arrowcraft Shop at Gatlburg, Tennessee, and we submit herewith the suiting attached statements. In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet Ld related statements of income and surplus Arent fairly the financial position of the Pi Beta Settlement School at June 30, 1941, and the come and expenses for the fiscal year then ended, bject to the extent of our own verification, which indicated above did not include the Gatlinburg cords. We examined and tested the income from Club Ld Chapter contributions, which are shown in dell in Schedule 3-a, and from magazine agencies Ld we found adequate support and authorization / the expenditures made directly by the Treaser. The cash balances at Milwaukee were verid by us. The endowment securities and cash, :cept cash in transit, were certified to by the arris Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago, Trus-.s for the endowment funds, and this Trustee's port was accepted without further verification cept that we checked the accounting made of anges in .investments and the income from se-rides and found it in good order. COMMENTS rsh Balances The cash balances at June 30, 1941, exclusive of 5h with the Endowment Trustees or in transit, n.sisted of the following: ilwaukee Accounts: First Wisconsin National Bank Treasurer's checking account $17,772.62 First Wisconsin National Bank Treasurer's savings account 1,040.22 ttlinburg School Accounts: Sevier County Bank School check ing account 116.69 Sevier County Bank House checking account 138.09 Sevier County Bank Arts and Crafts account 52.30 alinburg Arrow Craft Accounts: Sevier County Bank Checking ac count 2,660.05 Bank of Sevierville Savings account 3,018.75 Hamilton National Bank Savings ac count 6,133.62 Morris Plan Bank Savings account. Petty cash funds at Gatlinburg Total $37,158.35 As indicated above, we verified the balances in Milwaukee accounts while those at Sevierville or Knoxville were verified by Homer K. Jones and Company, according to their report. Accounts Receivable The Arrowcraft accounts receivable at June 30, 1941 amounted to $6,548.23 and were due principally from alumnae clubs. These accounts, which we did not verify, were listed in the report of Homer K. Jones and Company, and were $2,712.14 less than those at the close of the previous year. Fixed Assets Expenditures for additions to buildings, equipment, and landscaping amounted to $1,980.27 for the year under review. These expenditures are classified in Schedule 2. Depreciation of the buildings and equipment, computed at rates used in the past, totaled $3,072.46 as shown in the same schedule. Included in the income for 1940-1941 is a bequest of $9,250.00 which we are informed by your Treasurer was designated for building purposes and we understand that a building is now under construction which will absorb this amount but no expenditures for this purpose had been recorded prior to the close of the year. Endowment The only changes in the endowment principal for the year under review consisted of the three-fourths appropriation from chapter contributions of $1,404.75 offset to a considerable extent by losses on securities of $876.96, the fund showing a net increase of $527.79. The security losses were due to writing off a worthless bond of $1,000.00, the securities which were redeemed or sold actually yielding a profit of $123.04. No amortization of bond premiums is charged 'against income by the Trustee although the securities on hand cost $1,788.64 more than par value. These securities are listed in Schedule 1. Current Income and Expenses The income of the Settlement School exceeded operating expenses by $7,017.34 while the Arrow-craft net profit totaled $14,103.08. The Settlement School income, however, included the bequest of $9,250.00 for building purposes as pointed out above. On the other hand the expenses included depreciation of $3,072.46, a large part of which is attributable to operation of the Arrowcraft shops and stores. The Arrowcraft net income was approximately $3,300.00 greater than that of the previous year, the sales totaling $54,545.35 as compared to $42,951.03 for 1939-1940. The percentage of gross profit on sales was not quite as favorable for the current year as it was for 1939-1940.

The driveway has been changed to the side of the house with parking space toward the rear. This gives a solid expanse of lawn in front. Native shrubs surround it. One of the Park men helped us with the landscaping. The little rustic bridge at the side has been moved up the creek a few feet so that the school children do not cross the corner there. With a few more additions on the interior it should be complete. Hardly a customer fails to exclaim over its beauty. Taking it month by month through the year business has been consistently better. The amount of returns remained about the same but they were sent back earlier in the year as a whole. One particular club so far out-distanced all the rest this year they should be mentioned in this report. Berkeley up to June 1 has sold $1,911.80 with the month of June to bring it up to two thousand. The next highest sales record was the New York Club with $970.94. Dallas was a close third. To spoil that picture there is over $5,800 out-standing on our books against clubs. This represents unsold goods or failure to send in money promptly. I am still in hopes the month of June will clear up a great deal of that as our books go SCHOOL URING these last weeks of school Mrs. Weaver has been sorely missed. Perhaps I can give you a brief outline of some of the things that have happened. The grade school was out the latter part of April and the following teachers have been elected for next school year. Mr. Pern Price of. Gatlinburg will remain as Principal. Pauline Sharp, Eleanor Brabson, and Veryl Elder will return from the County. Doris Hatch, Illinois A and Flora Belle De Witt, Colorado B, will also return to us in the Fall. Due to the marriage of Ruth Parker and the resignation of Pauline Morris there will be two new Pi Phis to take their places, Mary Hayward, Arizona A, and Sue Viering, Illinois A. Mr. King, who has been Superintendent for ten years, tendered his resignation. Mr. Fleming will take his place. Cleo Nelson, North Dakota A, has also resigned. Miriam Moore, Kansas B, will be to an auditor the first day of July. The Fall Guild meeting was just over the mountain at the Cherokee Indian Reservation in North Carolina. The spring meeting was in Knoxville as usual, followed by a meeting of Southern Highlanders Inc. at Norris in the afternoon. The Southeastern Arts Association was meeting in Knoxville at the same time. A great number of our things were in their display. Besides attending those three meetings I have visited the John C. Campbell Folk School this past year. The Guild Shop in Asheville has done so well through the years that it was decided to use part of the small surplus to start another shop in the Shenandoah National Park. Arrowcraft, as a member, will have that as another market. We have already had several re-orders but it is too early to know if they will be able to sell as much as Allan-stand has for us. In making out a recent report I find that one third is sold as cash sales to the passing tourists, one sixth wholesale to other shops through the country, and one half by our own alumnae clubs and active chapters. That is a grand record to have kept through the years. Respectfully submitted, ETHEL WEAVER SNOW the Pi Phi to take her place. The new County teacher on the High School staff is to be Margaret Burchfield of Sevierville. -She is graduating with high honors from the University of Tennessee and will go on to summer school to finish her Library training so that she may have charge of the School Library along with her other work. The County board allowed us enough money for one other high school teacher this coming year. It has to be some one who can teach chemistry and I am still hoping some outstanding Pi Phi will offer her services. There is also a position open to a Pi Phi who knows double entry bookkeeping. Mrs. Elizabeth Peck, California B, comes to us very soon as the new Director. The rest of the school staff remains the same. Their reports will speak for themselves. Respectfully submitted, ETHEL WEAVER SNOW \ i \ T EPO Convention, June 21-27, 1942, New Ocean House, Swampscott, Mass. THE SEPTEMBER ARROW WEAVING DEPA ow that the Arrowcraft fiscal year for 1941 is about to pass into history, we can say hat we have produced more weaving during this han in any previous year. We have had a total of 7 women weaving for us which is not our highest ecord but they have earned more during the year han any other group. This year in the eleven aonths ending May 1941 they have earned 12,636.35. In the same period a year ago they tad earned $10,114.27 or a gain of $2,522.08. In )ecember 1940 we reached an all-time high for ,ne month when we paid the weavers $3,196.68. 'he weavers have shown their same loyalty and ooperation throughout the year that they always D. The play "Store Britches," the most ambitious indertaking the Weaver's Guild has ever atempted, was a decided success. The two casts gave 7 performances during the summer tourist season. 'he play was enthusiastically received by those vho saw it. The proceeds of the final performance vere given to the Gatlinburg Public Library and hey also gave $25.00 to the. Red Cross. Five veavers have borrowed from the fund to get ;lasses, one to pipe water into her house, and one a pay for an x-ray of her husband's stomach. They are planning to give the play again as a wrist attraction during July and August with the lea in mind of making it an annual affair whose hief value would be to keep alive in an authentic lay a bit of the fast-disappearing type of mountain amily life. This year the play will be under the omplete direction of Mrs. Phillip Maxwell. The greatest and most serious development as ar as our weaving is concerned during the year 3 the effect that the application of the Fair Labor tandards Act may have. The Southern Highland landicraft Guild has been carrying on negotiaions with the U. S. Department of Labor since 1st March. As this will affect not only Arrowcraft ut all handicraft organizations of the country qually, the Directors of the Guild thought that here is strength in unity and that we would get urther with the negotiations to have the Guild aembers represented as a whole rather than inividually. It is on. this basis that Arrowcraft has been ,articipating. All reports and correspondence that ve sent to Washington have been submitted to 4iss Onken or Mrs. Hagee first for approval. At the request of the Guild last March, as they were anticipating the investigation from Washagton anyway, the Hearings /Branch of the U. S. )epartment of Labor sent one of their staff memers to the annual meeting of the Guild in Knox-file. She stayed in the region three weeks making TMENT 1940-41 an extensive study of the work and set-up of the important centers in which Guild members were located. She stayed four days in Gatlinburg and visited not only Arrowcraft but the other shops as well, as they would have to comply with the law if they are in Interstate Commerce. This would automatically eliminate the price competition with which we have always been faced locally. Because hand-loom weaving would be the most difficult handicraft to readjust, a committee representing the important weaving members of the Guild was appointed with myself as chairman, to make an exhaustive study of weaving that is done in the homes and paid by the piece. This study included not only the producing but the marketing of weaving. The committee met in Gatlinburg on April 18 with seven weaving centers represented. The report of their findings has not yet been sent to the Department of Labor as they are still working on some of the questions that were sent to them by the Department of Labor to be studied. At the present time nothing definite has been decided and the issue is still in the hands of the President of the Guild and the Department of Labor. The future selling prices of weaving are hard to predict with the uncertainty that is attached both to the advancing of the prices for materials and the probable application to handicrafts of the Wage and Hour Act. I have tried to safeguard as much as possible against the continuous advance in the price of materials by buying in quantity supplies of wool and linen before the rise took place. This is only a temporary advantage for as long as the war lasts, prices will continue to change. Wool has gone up recently and linen has already advanced over 100% with the supply uncertain. We have on hand enough staple linen to last us 8 to 12 more months and wool to last 6 to 8 months at our present rate of production with but few additional purchases. Cotton prices have not advanced materially as yet. This will necessarily mean increasing our selling prices on many of the woven articles and the cautious weaving of all our linens. It would help our weaving program tremendously this fall if the Clubs would not over-estimate the linens they will need for their sales and order on the hand-to-mouth plan. Everything that we do not have to weave will conserve our supply of materials that cannot be replaced at the prices we paid for them. I hesitate to overstock in face of the uncertain times ahead. Respectfully submitted, WINOGENE B. REDDING PRINCIPAL'S ANNUAL EPO T, 1940.41 1st' THE 1940-41 school year opened on Tuesday after Labor Day, with the brightest promise of very successful school year. The opening day's nrollment was the largest on record for the high chool, and both pupils and teachers seemed nxious to get down to work. The teaching staff was composed of: William wing, principal, History and Social Science; Ben qeming, Mathematics, Science, and Coach; Cleo Nelson, English and Librarian; William Coe, Vocational Agriculture; Charlotte Herman, Vocational Home Economics; and William Oakes, Vocational Handicrafts. Miss Nelson and Miss Herman, the new members of the staff, while lacking in experience, worked hard at the job and the high school ran along as smoothly as could be expected. The large enrollment made a longer school day THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 49 necessary as more classes had to be taught by the same teaching force. The school day was lengthened from six to eight periods, and the length of the periods changed from sixty to forty-five minutes. A new course in Biology was introduced for the sophomore class and Sociology was added for the seniors. The course of study this year consisted of: English, four units; Science, three units; History, and Social Science, four units; Mathematics, three units; Vocational Agriculture, three units; Vocational Home Economics, three units, and Handicrafts, one unit; a total of twenty-one classes daily. The high school enrollment showed a consider-able increase of the preceding year. This rate of increase will probably continue for two more years and then will level off, unless school busses are added to bring students from other communities.

They won thirteen games and lost JENNIE N][COL MEMO TWENTY years ago, the Jennie Nicol Memorial Health Center moved into the little white cottage that had been the home of the Andrew Ogle family. Through the years of service and friendly understanding, the few cases of the beginning years have grown to hundreds. Methods change as need arises, but the pioneers builded well, and the policies have changed but little. One of the most important phases of the work of the Health Center, is the care of the maternity cases. Twenty-six mothers were on the records for the year, most of whom were under the super-vision of some doctor. Advice on diet and exercise, lists and articles for layettes, preparation for home delivery or for hospitalization were given. Regular check of weight and general condition were kept as often as possible. Some of the new babies had regular nursing care for a few days, and some as well as older babies had formulas or diets regulated as necessary. Many of them have been in for the Friday after-noon clinics many times. One premature baby was fed with a medicine dropper for several days, until she was strong enough to nurse, and kept in a warmed basket in lieu of an incubator. One baby developed pneumonia, with supplementary infection, and lived but twenty-four hours, in spite of every treatment that could be suggested by the specialists in Knoxville. An oxygen tank was even borrowed from a service station and an inhalation mask devised from a paper sack, all to no avail. Henry, aged two and a half, and nearly blind from an attack of meningitis the year previous, one during the regular playing season, and went to the semi-finals in the district tournament. Four-teen players were awarded letters at the close of the season. The Settlement School staff put on the play "Who's Crazy Now" to a large and appreciative audience. The purpose of the play was to raise money for a moving picture machine for the school. The junior class presented a play in the fall and the senior class gave two plays to raise money for their trip to Washington. The trip of the senior class to the nation's capital, was one of the high lights of the school year for the seniors. They worked all year to make the necessary money for transportation. They had a five day trip, going to Washington by way of Natural Bridge and the Skyline Drive. They spent two days sightseeing in Washington and returned home by way of Yorktown, Norfolk, and Virginia Beach. The various clubs of the school had a very active year. The Home Economics club and the FFA furnished much of the social life of the school. The glee club under the direction of Mrs. Chalmers and Miss Nelson furnished the music for commencement. Dr. Stewart W. McClelland, President of , Lincoln Memorial University, delivered the commencement address, and Rev. W. D. Wilkinson preached the Baccalaureate sermon. Twenty seniors received their diplomas. Respectfully submitted, WILLIAM KING, Principal IAL HEALTH CENTE had an eye examination by Dr. Robert Leech of Knoxville. The child seems to do little more than distinguish light from darkness, and there seems little hope of any improvement. Probably at some later date, he may be placed in some school for some sort of training. Little red-headed Marjorie, whose left foot was straightened by Dr. Bagwell, is walking freely. Six months old Margaret has both tiny legs in casts for club foot correction. She is a patient of the Crippled Children's Clinic, and reports there on alternate Fridays for observation, change of cast or treatment. The Crippled Children's work is done under the auspices of the Sevier County Post of the American Legion, and by state funds. School inspections were held at intervals during the year at Gatlinburg, and at the six rural schools. Inoculations for typhoid, diphtheria, and small pox were made as necessary in each place. Talks pertaining to health were ,made in class rooms and in other meetings. The general health of the school children seems to be improving year by year. Fewer are underweight, due to supervised lunches, and increased knowledge of both parents and children. The Sevierville Lions Club has bought glasses for several children of the district, and r sorority aids in the correction of defects. A number of children had tonsils removed, a few had appendectomies, and many visited the dentist. There were innumerable dressings, a few fractures, and many sprains. But the high light of the school health program is the lessening of the old enemy, impetigo. Better living conditions, more balanced 10 \ 50 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW diet, and persistence of treatment, are undoubtedly responsible. Community nursing consists mostly of emergency or special treatment. Post-operative dressings, massage, hypodermics, irrigations, and instruction in home nursing. Several were taken to Cancer or Tuberculosis Clinics, and for X-rays. Three doctors in Sevierville have infirmaries, and rapid ambulance service has made it possible to transport patients quickly and safely. The Loan Closet continues to be of great service. Crutches, rubber sheeting, bed pans, hot water bottles, and ice caps are borrowed in case of need, and returned for the use of others. Night clothing for children and adults, and baby things are used again and again. As always, we are grateful for the cooperation met on every side, from the doctors who so freely give advice and aid, the members of the staff, and of the Fraternity. Above all, we are grateful for the friendship and appreciation of the people of the community. The work of the Health Center seems to go beyond mere physical needs. Worry and unhappiness are as tangible as disease, and a tonic for the ELEMENTA THE Ij[ B (1, Elementary School opened on September 3, 1940 with the following teachers: Eleanor Brabson, primer; Doris Hatch, first grade; Ruth Parker, second grade; Veryle Elder, third grade; Pauline Morris, fourth grade; Pauline Sharp, fifth grade; Flora Belle DeWitt, sixth and seventh grades ; C. Pern Price, eighth grade. For the seventh consecutive year the II B Elementary School has won the cup in the Blue Ribbon contest for the larger schools. This is quite a distinction as no other school in the county, large or small, can equal this record. For the second year the elementary school has been given a rating of 100% in the sanitation program. We are one of the twelve schools in the county to make this record. A number of books for our library were given to us by friends from Muncie, Indiana. Most all system no more necessary than a tonic for morale. It is our sincere hope that the Health Center may continue to stand for those things, whatever they may be, that will make life happier and more healthful for our people. Following is the summary of the work of the past year, in comparison with that of the pre ceding period. 1939 40 Class of Work 1940 41 Field visits 2,187 1,922 Office calls 2,283 2,349 Surgical dressings 2,002 2,106 Pupil inspections 2,165 2,140 Health talks 69 78 Diphtheria immunization 53 67 Schick tests 49 78 Small pox vacccinations 125 170 *Total typhoid shots 442 1,261 Completed typhoid series 269 400 Other inoculations 163 302 * New state ruling makes it possible to give but one Typhoid inoculation on alternate years after the initial series of three. MARJORIE CHALMERS, R.N. Y SCHOOL the books were fiction. On April 8, 1941, the faculty of the high school and elementary school gave a play, "Who's Crazy Now." In addition to the faculty Mrs. Snow and Miss Redding took part. The purpose of this play was to take the proceeds and apply on a 16 mm. motion picture machine for use of the school. The enrollment for 1940-41 was 285. The average daily attendance was 225. Inattendance, "flu" and other reasons kept this lower than it should have been. The elementary school had its first football team. Out of five games played they did not lose a game and had their goal line crossed only twice during the season. The largest eighth grade class to finish school in the elementary department finished this year. C. PERN PRICE HANDICRAFTS FoR my report I am giving you an exact list of the articles that were made by the high school group for the past year. There were fourteen in this group that finished this year. Five were seniors and nine juniors. There were five of this group who took other classes during this class period. Some few of them came in the afternoons to make some of this time up. I never had the entire group in the shop at the same time. I could not give the organized work that I should have given, because of this. There were some few that be-came quite skilled. If they could go on with this work, they could accomplish something. As it is they can't take another year because they have had two vocational credits and can have only four to graduate. This course gives two. All of the equipment is in first class order. There have been only a few tools lost. A handsaw, hammer, and a pair of side cutting pliers disappeared while the plumbers were here. Every member of the group this year made an article for the school, to be left here. Many thanks for the job and the many favors, Sincerely, WILLIAM O. OAKES HOME ECONOMICS DEPARTMENT ORTY-SEVEN girls were enrolled in Home five were freshmen, ten were sophomores, and FEconomks the largest number in the history twelve were juniors. The seniors were unable to of the Settlement School. Of this group, twentytake Home Economics as an elective because it THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 51 conflicted with their required courses. In the freshman class, the most popular units were those in clothing construction. The girls made simple blouses, skirts, and aprons in the fall to learn how to use the sewing machine and how to follow a commercial pattern. Some of the girls had sewed considerably at home so each girl chose a clothing problem according to her own skill level so that she could learn something new in her class project. At the end of the six weeks' unit in sewing, the class judged the dresses, and on this basis, two achievement awards were made. The awards were pins given by a commercial pattern company. The girls were very proud of their prizes. During the first semester, we also studied personal grooming, etiquette, and breakfast preparation and service. In October, the freshmen gave an afternoon tea for their mothers and the school staff. This was the climax of their study of manners, introductions, and the art of being a hostess. During the foods units the girls were divided into families for the purpose of working together in planning and preparing the food. Each family served a breakfast in early December, inviting one of the elementary school teachers as guest. In the second semester the freshmen studied child care and development, using their own brothers and sisters at home for observation; preparation and serving of luncheons; school lunches; and food for outdoor hikes and picnics. The sophomore class seemed to be most interested in the foods units. In our first unit food preservation, we canned tomatoes, and apple sauce, and made orange marmalade and apple jelly. As a result of this study, two of the girls made jelly for home projects. Awards similar to those the freshmen received were given the sophomores on the completion of their fall wool dresses. The weaving for the sophomores worked out very well this year because there was an even number of girls in the class so that each pair could work on one loom. Three of our six weeks were spent in making the warps and in setting up the looms for weaving. Each girl then wove a sampler, a towel, and a pillow top. While half the girls were weaving, the others were sewing on baby garments for the American Red Cross. Other units that the sophomores studied included: elements of nutrition, personal grooming, and luncheon preparation and service. 0 MITO THE year of 1940-41 has been a very busy one. As in any household, looking back, it is hard to say what has been accomplished. The culinary department has been taken care of by Belle Lowe and Mrs. Lurie Hurst, and the necessary upkeep such as mending, new curtains, helping the boys and girls, has fallen to me. Two of our girls left us in April to ride the bus to school, but I replaced them by another. The juniors were especially interested in individual development, so our year's work was planned along that line. The first semester they studied personality improvement, personal grooming, clothing budgets and wardrobes, and clothing construction. Two of the girls made wool suits, several made afternoon dresses, and the others made wool school dresses. One week was spent in the, study of vocations for girls. Nursing, office work, and elementary school teaching were especially interesting to the class. The second semester the juniors took up special party cookery, food and health, textiles, clothing construction, and outdoor cookery. At Christmas time, the sophomores planned the menu, decorated, and served the annual dinner for the faculty. The juniors were in charge of food preparation. This spring the juniors planned and prepared the food for the F.F.A. boys and their parents, and the freshmen and sophomores decorated and served. Ninety guests were served in the general science laboratory. Four girls went to the Open House at the University of Tennessee. One junior modelled a two-piece wool dress and a sophomore modelled a spring skirt and jerkin. In March, the juniors took a field trip to Knoxville to visit the furniture stores, after studying about the different types of furnishings suitable for their own homes. Each girl completed three home projects, in addition to her class work. Sewing seemed to be the most popular type of project. Among the projects were: quilts, baby and children's clothes, curtains, pillow cases, slip covers for chairs, and all types of clothes for the girls themselves. Some of the food projects were: baking; preparation of breakfasts, luncheons, and suppers; and a study of pastries. The Home Economics Club had fifty-five members this year. Bi-weekly meetings were held, with programs planned by the girls at each meeting. From November through March, the Home Economics teacher and the Agriculture teacher con-ducted a joint class for adult men and women at the Laurel Grove School in Wear's Valley. The classes met an hour and a half every two weeks. Among the topics discussed for women were: home gardens, menu planning, food and health, and canning. Respectfully submitted, CHARLOTTE HERMAN MS, 1940-41 I have bought five unfinished dressers for th, girls' dormitory and finished them, and had tit floor in the dining room sanded and waxed, an( with Mrs. Hagee's assistance bought a linoleun rug for "Miss Georgic's" room. I would recommend that the kitchen be painted and if it is possible that an electric mixer b purchased for the kitchen. Respectfully submitted, ANNETTE MORSE 5 2 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE ALL DAY CLASSES: This year's enrollment in this group reached a total of fifty-one boys. Three classes were taught in Vocational Agriculture. These classes consisted of twenty-five freshman boys, another class was made up of seventeen sophomores and still another consisted of eight iunior and senior boys. This year we had thirty-four of the fifty-one beginning boys to complete the entire school year. The remaining thirty-foul boys are at present conducting complete supervised Farming Programs. EVENING SCHOOL CLASSES: One night school was conducted in the Laurel Grove Community for those men who are established in the business of farming. This adult class I teach at least one night out of each month and this continues throughout the year. This year we had seventeen meetings with a total of fifty-three farmers enrolled. Our course of study is based on the needs of the community. We made surveys to determine what were the farming and living conditions of the Laurel Grove Community. After spending one class meeting in a discussion of our data, the farmers came to the conclusion that their greatest problem was low income. Farmers were then led to set up objectives which would increase their farm income. They were: 1. To increase soil fertility through (a) liming (b) phosphating (c) rotating crops (d) growing winter cover crops 2. To provide livestock of good type to consume all feed produced on the farm. 3. To produce the home food supply on the farm as nearly as possible. 4. To improve the farm home and its surroundings through (a) providing electric lights and running water in the home. (b) repairing the farm home. (c) improving the home grounds. PART-TIME CLASSES: This year one class was taught to a group of out-of-school boys at Camp Morgan, the CCC camp which is located five miles away from the school. I met with this group of thirty-two boys one night each week to study problems pertaining to farming. These boys as a group have three projects on the camp grounds: 1. Poultry 2. Bees 3. Rabbits On January 1 of this year, there came aid through the Sevier County Board of Education to provide National Defense Training for out-ofschool rural and urban youth. The supervision of these .classes became the job of the Vocational Agriculture Teachers throughout the State. Our School provided two of these classes to this group. One of these was taught by Mr. Walter Cardwell in woodworking, in which twenty-five boys were enrolled. The other class is now being taught at Pigeon Forge Elementary School House by Mr. Fred Cooper. This course is in elementary electricity, in which twenty students are enrolled. It is hoped that these boys will be better able to do the necessary jobs in preparation for war or in time of war. We have an improved Farm Shop as a result of this training. We now have $264.00 worth of additional equipment for our farm shop. We think this equipment will become the property of Sevier County Board of Education and this will be left with the Agricultural Department of our School. THE FFA CHAPTER: The Future Farmers of America chapter has completed a most successful year. We have taken part in the following outside activities of the School: 1. Showing Dairy Cattle at the County Fair. 2. Exhibiting Farm products, farmshop work, and poultry at the County Fair and at the Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial Fair at Knoxville. 3. Sponsored FFA and Home Economics socials. 4. Livestock and Dairy cattle judging contest at the University of Tennessee in which sixty-eight high school chapters of FFA competed. (Pi Phi won third place in Livestock and Roy McCarter, a senior FFA boy, was high point contestant of the whole contest in which 209 boys entered.) 5. Sponsored Third Annual Parent and Son Banquet. (FFA boys invited their mothers and fathers. Eighty-seven parents and guests attended.) 6. Public Speaking contest at University. (Roy Ogle, a senior FFA boy, placed second in the 5th district which had 14 chapters competing.) 7. FFA Baseball and Basketball teams. 8. Presentation of the FFA cup to best All-around high school girl. 9. Two boys continue to produce Hybrid corn for seed. Last year one boy sold $224.00 worth of seed corn harvested from one acre. 10. Four town boys who are taking agriculture have rented land from the airport and have what appears to be successful Home Gar-dens. Some of these boys have in addition, Home Improvement, and twenty-five to fifty chicks for broilers. 11. CAMP CLEMENTS Five boys and I at-tended the Tennessee FFA camp for one week last summer. (Pi Phi won the athletic award for that week's activities.) 12. FFA field day, the last Saturday in April, found us competing in field meets at Powell Station High School, Knox County, with FFA chapters of the 5th district. The boys did well in the events, but their total points were not enough to surpass the Powell Station FFA. 13. RADIO PROGRAMS. This year the Pi Beta Phi FFA sponsored two programs over WNOX. The first program was presented by four boys who were growing Hybrid corn for seed. The Title of the program was GROWING HYBRID CORN. Our second program was entitled THE AGRICULTURAL CONDITION OF SEVIER . COUNTY AND HOW THE VOCATION-AL AGRICULTURE AT PI BETA PHI PLAYS ITS PART. This program was given by four senior FFA boys. 14. Tennessee FFA Convention was attended THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 53 by five boys and myself in Memphis, Tennessee, April 25 and 26. Our chapter was presented with the camp award, mentioned as a third place winner of the Livestock Judging contest and also that Roy McCarter from II B (1) had made the highest number of points of any boy in the East Tennessee Livestock judging contest. Dot Fox, a junior, and also a Hybrid Corn Grower, was awarded the degree of the Tennessee State planter. Dot plans to try to become an American farmer within the next two years. The fifth district of FFA offered three money awards to the best supervised farming program conducted by a boy last year. Dot won the second prize and the first prize went to a University of Tennessee Freshman boy of the college of agriculture. THE SCHOOL FARM: This year we had eight boys in the Dormitory who did the work on the farm and janitor work in the school houses. Six of these boys took Vocational Agriculture. They were given charge of certain enterprises in which they were responsible in their work. This causes the boy to take more interest in his work and thus a better job is done. Last fall our Jerseys, poultry, hogs, and farm products placed well at our County Fair. We had the Grand Champion animal of the Jersey Show. This year we have 140 white Leghorn hens in our laying flock. 100 white Leghorn sexed baby chicks were bought for replacements in the laying flock next fall. 800 baby chicks were bought and fed to broiler weight for Dining hall and to sell to the hotel. Mountain View Hotel uses all of our extra broilers which we produce and gives us a good price for them. Two modern brooder houses were constructed on the farm by agriculture boys as a part of their training in Agriculture. A water line was laid from the Boys' Dormitory to the incubator house. This makes it possible for us to provide ample water for livestock at the barn without having to carry it.
