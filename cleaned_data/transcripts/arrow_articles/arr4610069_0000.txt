        68 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI notes, in compliance with our suggestions. Some make no answer to repeated inquiries, and take no steps toward collection. We consider this one of the most important financial weaknesses of the chapters which remains to be overcome. Since the girls do not fully realize the importance of this matter, and this office can only ad-vise, we wonder what would be the general reaction if Grand Council should devise some plan by which the supervisor would report to the Grand President chapters carrying the same delinquents for more than one month, with the idea that the chapters would be fined by Grand Council just as they are fined for not sending in reports on time. This office is planning to get out a letter to each chapter president in September, asking her cooperation in reducing the delinquent list, and suggesting ways and means as used in other chapters for eliminating this evil. Again may we bring to your attention the disadvantage of special assessments. As the main value of a budget is to predetermine the house bill and the chapter expenses, collecting special assessments from members entirely defeats the purpose. In a great many cases it has been demonstrated that the yearly change in treasurers has been responsible for temporary mis-use of the Busey System. We strongly recommend that whenever possible the same treasurer hold office for two years, and that the out-going treasurer take pains to instruct the new treasurer in her duties thoroughly. The new treasurer should always be chosen from girls who are confident of returning the fol-lowing September, and should be selected for her ability and not for her popularity or her need of the financial assistance. The National Supervisor feels that an overwhelming per cent of the chapters are using the Busey System successfully now, and that the difficulty in some few chapters is due to the fact that they are not using the whole system wholeheartedly. Most chapters have shown an increasing prosperity and stability during the year, and have given this office splendid cooperation in every detail.

Respectfully submitte DOROTHY BURROWS MARIE FREEMAN PA Report of Chairman of Settlement School Comnh The year of 1928-29 for the school has been decidedly one of marking time, and while there has been the improvement dictated by experience along many lines, there has also been an absence of outstanding events characteristic of any con-tented routine life. So far the radical changes anticipated from the establishment of the Smoky Mountain National Park have materialized only in a rather widespread selling of property and exodus of people from the vicinity of the Sugarlands and the steady increase of tourists. The constant growth in the last few years in the number of pupils, the amount of detail work to be done in managing so large an establishment, and the great number of visitors to the school are bringing us face to face with the vital need for additions to the staff. It is difficult to say which we need most. With the building, repairing, and remodeling of old buildings, the road making and upkeep in our owngrounds, the minor plumb: electrical installations, the vision of student labor, overseeing of the farm, wl all constantly necessary, finding it almost imperative a man to manage that phas( work.

Overton and the Sugar-:aff have pursued the same .t course of instruction as Lr. Every teacher has her rtificate so we are assured ler rating. Miss Kibler is academic teacher who will .ern to us and we lose her ret. The plan at the Sugar-E having two teachers and a housekeeper who does a great deal of community work has proved very satisfactory. Among the special teachers we are sorry to report several resignations, each of them an extremely difficult place to fill. No other one person could do for us all that Mr. Mattil has done in his eight years at the school, and we owe him an enormous debt of gratitude not only for the work he has accomplished but for his unfailing interest and loyalty. Miss Redding's work is probably more widely known to the fraternity in general than that of any other teacher, for it is she who de-signs the lovely and original things sent out from the Arrowcraft Shop each year and who has so painstakingly instructed the mountain people in order to produce articles of such a high degree of artistic and technical excellence. She has trained so thoroughly some of her apter pupils, and too, Miss Allen, who runs the Shop, has worked so closely and sympathetically with her that there will be no diminution from the high standards she has set, but her position is a hard one to fill and we shall miss her keenly. The work of Mrs. Farmer, the home economics teacher, is not so widely known, but it has had a strong influence in the community itself. One outstanding example of her ability was the remodeling and furnishing under her supervision and from materials at hand of a mountain cabin which won second prize in a national better homes competition. The writeup and pictures of this in THE ARROW have given you some idea of the splendid influence such work has in the community and how much of a loss her REPORTS OF OFFICERS 71 resignation means to us. Mrs. Farmer represents a truly Panhellenic spirit, for she is a Chi Omega and we have never had a teacher more devoted to the interests of the school. The health center was handicapped for several months by not having a nurse, but since November the position has been ably filled by Frances Moore, and the plans undertaken by the county for next year give promise of better results than ever before. During the frequent periods in the last three years when we have been without a nurse, Lillie Reagan, a Gatlinburg girl who assists at the health center, has tided over the intervals by helping the doctors who held clinics and doing some nursing, and to her we owe the fact that this valuable work has not been al-lowed to lapse over long periods but has been kept in such good condition that a new nurse could quickly pick up the threads without having to waste time in reorganization. This training of latent, native ability is one of the most vital results of our work at Gatlinburg and we are proud of every example of it which comes back like bread cast upon the waters. There are many who have gone out to other schools and communities, many who raise the standard of living conditions in Gatlinburg, and in the school itself, beside Lillie Reagan are Cora Mc-Carter, who until last year taught in the Sugarlands, Otha Reagan who supervises the student labor, and Arlie Watson who has substituted during Otha's long illness this spring, Ernest Reagan, who does all the odd jobs of repairing, electric lighting, etc., Alice McCarter, who has taught weaving in the school, Veatress Parton, who has helped in the Arrowcraft Shop; the three or four girls who have cooked at different times; and the dormitory girls and boys who do much of the work about the house and farm. Miss Bishop has as always con-ducted the many problems of ad-ministration with the tact and wisdom which endear her to everyone with whom she has contact and make her service to the fraternity of incalculable value. Her report will give you all the interesting de-tails which this summary lacks. Work with the committee this year has been an inspiration and pleasure and I sincerely regret that the completion of my four year term brings that close association to an end. The service of Edith Gordon and Blanche Curtis to the fraternity in other fields is already so well known, that I need not tell you how invaluable has been their work for the school, nor with what confidence and satisfaction I turn over the du-ties of chairman to Dr. Gordon. Ethel Curryer's efficient work as treasurer is familiar to you all and the success of financing our heavy building program for the last two years is due to her skillful management. Marguerite Ellis last fall provided the slides and films with new containers and has supervised their journeys to Alpha, Delta, and Kappa provinces. She has managed a trying job splendidly. Dr. Gordon reports that letters were sent to isolated alumme in an effort to have them join the national alumnae organization and to interest them in work for the school, but as the replies were sent to the province vice presidents, the response is not yet correlated. Mrs. Curtis has pre-pared the Little Pigeon articles for THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI BROW and sent a letter of to each club and chapter for :-ibution. Through these let-m the committee, the month-, and Gatlinburg News from ool, and frequent bulletins Le Arrowcraft Shop, a close aication with many members fraternity has been main constructive help and pleas-tact with Grand Council and 1 officers has been greatly apd and enjoyed. re again grateful to Mr. Col-r insurance agent, for a sub-gift to the school, and also and Mrs. Rogers of Mt. It, Iowa, for the gift of five thousand of the leaflets of information which are available at this convention. And for the help, cooperation, and generous contributions from the fraternity at large the committee gives its most grateful thanks. We are particularly glad to note the in-creasing number of contributions which come in around Christmas time, and if every club and chapter could realize what worry it saves the treasurer to have money coming in during the lean months of December, January, and February, when expenditures are very heavy, we are sure the custom would be-come universal. GERTRUDE B. FREEMAN Report of Director of Settlement School 'riting a report of the past am impressed with the fact has been one of completing, as possible, projects already rather than a year of new While this is in many ways story it does lack, the thrill work and the finishing tasks edious and hard when they so many months. structure of the new building Tactically completed by the Le new term started in Aug-: the heating, plumbing, and were yet to be put in. The t task came with the building power house. It had been I that a central heating sys-)uld be put in now, the school gs being put on the same sysonce, and plans laid for add-her cottages to it when it wise. This came after the building program of the ro years, when we were corn-worn out with that kind ofwork and worry. Excavating for the power house brought other problems if the dirt and rock blasted out of that hole, twenty feet by forty feet by eleven feet, was to be used for building up our roads, the lanes must be tiled first. Ditches of appalling depth had to be dug all over the place and it seemed all winter that we never would be cleared up and smoothed over again. By spring things were very nearly graded and seeded down and we felt that we had buried a world of troubles in each of those ditches. The next year should be a much easier one. While it is a regret to bring coal soot and smoke into our lovely mountains we do keep much more comfortable than in the days when even green wood was hard to get. Can it be possible that we now use two carloads of coal, in addition to all the fire and stove wood? Practically the same program has REPORTS OF OFFICERS 73 been followed in every department. No radical changes have occurred anywhere. Yet in some ways it has been one of the most difficult years we have had. No doubt the fact that for the past six months there has not been a single day when every member of the staff has been able to be on duty has called for real effort to keep up the morale. The flu epidemic which came before Christmas and lasted all winter had not released its hold on some of the family when school closed in the spring. In addition to this it has been a year when trying repairs be-came necessary. Difficulties with the water system, unsatisfactory electric current, and other almost daily troubles had to be met. Last year I mentioned the pro-posed Smoky Mountain National Park. At present it seems as though the "land sale" methods used during the winter have stopped and we hope people back in the hollows will not be too hasty in moving away. Our immediate territory has not been seriously affected. Even the Sugarlands has almost as many families still living there, although eventually that section is sure to be in the park boundary. Until the large timber tracts can be purchased the state cannot turn the land over to the government. When this really becomes a park is more than we can say and in the meantime there is no reason why we should not continue calmly on. Already a road through the Sugarlands to the top of the Smoky Mountain range is graded and with-in three or four months will be in condition for cars to go the entire way and it is a most beautiful drive to the North Carolina line. I regret that a list has not beenkept of the visiting Pi Phis for scarcely a day goes by, winter or summer, that one or more do not come. Many stay for a few hours ; some get only to the Arrowcraft Shop; others take time enough to see the whole place and even make a quick trip to Sugarlands (for quick trips there are now possible). We surely enjoy and appreciate these visits and we only hope those coming receive as much pleasure and inspiration as their visits give us. And Washington and Niagara Falls are not the only places sometimes I think Gatlinburg bids fair to be a Pi Phi honeymoon resort. The staff has been: Evelyn Bishop, director. W. B. Overton, principal, junior high teacher. Kathefine Kibler, junior high teacher. Alice Williams, fifth and sixth grades. Henrietta McCutchan, third and fourth grades. Eleanor Brabson, primer, first and second grades. O. J. Mattil, Smith Hughes agriculture. Katherine Katson Farmer, Smith Hughes home economics. Winogene Redding, weaving.

SCHOOL n spite of the confusion caused the unfinished building and so ch sickness, we feel we can re-'t a more than usually successful :he total enrollment was 168--:nty-six of that number were in t and second year high school. Vlr. Overton had accomplished much the year previous in seing certificates, rating, etc., for school that the new year started much easier. Every teacher had state certificate at the opening school and there were no doubts )ut the rating with the state de--tment. dr. Overton and Miss Kibler had same classes as the year before, Overton taking all the mathetics for the seventh, eighth, ,th, and tenth grades and Miss )ler all the English. In the fall se classes were held in the new lding but as mornings grew cool y would be one day in the old 1 the next in the new. Finally it s necessary to go back into the quarters and stay there until heating system was completed January. Light pupils completed second Lr high school and all expect to enter some other school in the fall. While only three received eighth grade certificates the first year high school class will probably have the usual number as nearly all those pupils come from nearby schools but far enough away to make it necessary for them to be in the dormitory. Eleanor Brabson, Alice Williams, and Henrietta McCutchan made a splendid team and although they were here for the first time they found no difficulty in quickly adjusting themselves to their new work as they were three very efficient teachers. Alice had the fifth and sixth grades, Henrietta the third and fourth, and Eleanor the primary, first, and second. There is a real criticism that could be made and I hope before long we can consider a change. The three grades, primer, first, and second, have the largest enrollment and are in the same room under the same teacher. The year we had kindergarten work for the youngest ones was most satisfactory and I trust another year it will be possible for a budget allowance to provide again for this work. While the four upper grades have a nine months school term these others have only eight months. Henrietta. McCutchan and Mr. Overton coached the basketball teams and, as many of the pupils had never seen a game before coming here, it meant starting from the beginning. After getting into the new building light practice was made compulsory for all seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth grade boys and girls. The teams entered the East Tennessee high school tournament and although we were the only two year high school entrant our pupils made a very creditable show REPORTS OF OFFICERS ing. Another year both Mr. Over-ton and Miss McCutchan hope to do more along the line of supervised play. The usual plays and social affairs were given during the year and in whatever was done the cooperation was unusually good. We are sorry to have Miss Kibler leave this spring and very glad the other grade teachers will re-turn. All three special teachers are leaving this year, Mr. Mattil, Katherine Farmer, and Winogene Red-ding and the places will be hard to fill. Of the eight pupils completing second year high last year six have been in school this year, one in Newport High, one in Maryville High, three in Sevierville High, and one in Murphy Institute. The other two have been working this year to earn money to enter school next fall. Mrs. Duffield and Mrs. Gilbert, both former music teachers and now living in Gatlinburg, have given mu-sic lessons to quite a number of pupils but there has been no pul)lic school music taught in the school. This is always a regret as there is such a wonderful opportunity to develop this native talent. This year shows a still better reimbursement from the county for maintaining the eight grades of the day school, due to all teachers having state professional certificates. The county has paid us the past year for teachers and fuel $3,318. This does not include any of the state funds allowed us for agriculture, weaving, and home economics. The class work in agriculture, home economics, and weaving is incorporated into the reports of those departments. HoME EcoNomics The usual home economics cla; were held for first and second y high school girls; each class hav two periods every morning.

Katherine Watson devoted p tically all of her time to reg school work home economics science classes. They kept her f having time for evening sc work although she did manag get in one afternoon class each ti and the latter part of the year in one night class. Two intensive sewing c12 were held by Mrs. Zuccarellc the state department, and the di making done during those w was nothing short of ama; THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI ese courses were financed partly the state and partly by those ing the course. The exhibit at Gatlinburg Fair showed what week of sewing had accornshed. The home economics work closed the year at the end of the school m, no community classes being -ried on during the vacation. ks Katherine Watson married we a vacancy to fill at the end of school year. Miss Mary Rachel mstrong, University of Tenneswill take Katherine's place and, less present plans fail, will devote 7 entire time to home economics : cool classes in the morning and nmunity classes in the afternoon. already a full program is being rked out for the new year and we ill be glad to again take up these nmunity classes that we feel are very worth while. SGRICULTURE AND FARM SHOP [n writing a report of this departnt we have to remember that Mr. ittil has had so many different es of work outside of school rou e that we wonder he has been e to accomplish one-half that he n Smith Hughes agriculture !re is a school program that takes morning, each class having two -iods every day. This corre-)nds to the home economics pro-Lm. The afternoons should be en over to community work such junior poultry clubs, spraying pruning of orchards, advising stock and crops, veterinary ad e and treatment, and in fact do-; about everything called for. e shop work is along the line practical farm aid, making wag-beds and wheel barrows, self feeders for chickens and pigs, harness repairing, care of tools, etc. Each boy from the seventh grade up has a home project which he keeps an accurate record of, under the supervision of the teacher. These are varied. Some boys take a pig for a project, some a cow, others have crop projects. Many take poultry. The past two years the building program and other improvements have taken much of Mr. Mattil's time as he has supervised all these. It has been a real regret to him and to us that the educational work in nearby communities where he had had clubs and classes had to be dropped for this but no person could have handled both. In addition to these there is the farm to supervise and the student labor to keep in touch with. After seven years spent in organizing and building up this department Mr. Mattil feels he must give up teaching. We will have a hard task to fill his place, in fact shall not try to find anyone who can shoulder so much. He has done an outstanding piece of work which is recognized and appreciated by all. With the beginning of the new school year we shall go back to a distinct school program in this department, endeavoring to keep the outside things entirely separate from the work that rightfully be-longs to this department. For a year or more Mr. Mattil has been carrying on a very interesting piece of work independent of the school, yet somewhat associated with it too. The demands for antiques were so insistent he finally fitted up the old barn, near the school building, as a shop; putting an electric system and motors, REPORTS OF OFFICERS wood working machinery, etc., and employed from one to five boys to refinish old furniture and reproduce crickets, book shelves, tables, and in fact many different kinds of things which are sold in. the Arrow-craft Shop. The training these boys have had in the shop has been of the best and we only hope that Mr. Mattil has been able to at least come out even financially with the proposition. There is no doubt but that this has had a great influence on the furniture makers of the community for they are now bringing in better furniture than ever before. I am sure that eventually the school will want to take this over but at the present time we are only too glad to have Mr. Mattil want to keep it. FARM AND STUDENT LABOR The report of the farm and of the student labor is most satisfactory. More has been raised in the garden for the table, stock well cared for, fields in better condition, the place showing improvement generally. We are asked many times what we keep on the farm. We have three horses, one for farm work, two for the nurse and teachers. Four cows, one registered heifer gotten this past year, a registered Jersey bull, five Berkshire hogs, Barred Rock poultry, two Shropshire sheep gotten this year. About 100 hens are kept during the win-ter. At present we have nearly 1,000 little chicks, some to keep, most to be sold during the summer for ' fryers. Our incubators and brooders do service for the whole community. The farm and the student laboris all looked after by Otha Rea under the supervision and plann of Mr. Mattil. Otha is a ma: hand with the boys and as he been here a long time he is tl~ oughly familiar with Mr. Mat methods and can take a great of responsibility. Otha has b away because of illness for the five months and the work has b done by a former dormitory who has shown himself very c able. Having dormitory boys 1 year who had been here some t. has been a great help for all h shown themselves so very depe able and willing during this h siege. DORMITORIES Each year we are more fully c winced that the time and money u in supervising and providing a home life for our students who too far from the school to walk b and forth is well spent. The year we have had from six to boys and from eight to twelve g in the dormitories. Each stud has had regular hours of labor practically have had to look out all school expenses without any from home. Three boys had homes so their problems were larger ; how to earn enough fo new pair of overalls or shirt c hair cut in addition to all other penses. More than half of the mitory students finished their w here this spring so these places be filled this fall by new pupils. We have been most fortunat, having Mrs. Morgan in the g dormitory and to take care of meals for all this large family Iv] numbers now from thirty-five forty-five all the time. Mrs. I\ gan has planned splendid meals her care and training of the THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI all that anyone could ask. difficult task and one that day and night for the seven the week.

Due to in family in the past few .e septic tank built ten years ago is inadequate and a new one must be put in this summer with new sewage lines. That will also be done by our men here. Mother made the move from the girls' to the boys' dormitory last fall and found the boys as nice to deal with as the girls. Discipline in either dormitory is not difficult but when one is willing and interested she can find plenty to do at either place and that kind of work requires being constantly with it. The past year two rooms in the teachers' cottage have been used by the boys, one for a dressing and wash room, one for a clubroom. The cottage in which they lived was too far for them to get to during the day. This summer we have rented the Jim Reagan cottage, which ad-joins our property and is near enough for all the needs of the boys. While the cottage is small the lo-cation so near the school will repay any other inconveniences they may have. The same schedule of work has been held to this year as last, the girls getting experience in practically every kind of work pertaining to homemaking, the boys in every-thing relating to stock and farm as well as general repair and up-keep work. LOCAL LABOR Not only the student labor but all the outside work has been done more satisfactorily the past year than ever before. Arlie Watson has taken care of furnaces and odd tasks during the winter, during the spring and summer has had a wonderful garden (which i used to supply our tables and also families who live in the Burg during the summer) and of course kept up many other duties. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 79 He and Otha Reagan make a fine team. Ernest Reagan continues to be with us and is the man for wiring, plumbing, repairing anything and everything. Two local girls who received some training in the evening class in home economics have done the cooking. Lillie Reagan continues as the nurse's assistant. We have eight local people on the pay roll and are proud of every one of them. WEAVING Again we can report continued growth in this department. While there have been the usual number of new products added to the Shop, things beautiful and decidedly sale-able, there has been a marked development in the real knowledge of the mechanics and art of weaving among the women. It has taken great effort to keep the weaving divided as equally and evenly among the people as possible and during the year forty-six women wove for the school, also four high school girls earned money in this way to continue school next year. Supervising weaving in fifty homes is a full-time task but the products show how well it is done. In addition to the individual instruction there have been six group meetings, with from sixteen to thirty women in attendance. These are possible since the new weaving room is finished. The new weaving, office, and storage rooms are almost too good to be true, and have relieved the stress" and strain in that department and other places too. Last spring the Smith Hughes vocational funds reimbursed us for the instruction given the afternoon class of women and with this money we employed Alice McCarter thisyear as assistant to Miss Redding. Alice is one of our local girls who has woven for us for years and is called the "loom doctor" because of being so expert in diagnosing and treating loom troubles of all kinds. I am glad to report that once again we have our regular classes in weaving for our school girls. The seventh and eighth grade girls have had two periods each day during the year, Alice and Miss Red-ding doing the teaching. Four new looms were gotten before school opened and three others rebuilt. With new weaving room and new looms, the results were most satisfactory. We are expecting reimbursement from the state again and hope that Alice will be able to continue her work another year. Weaving in the homes continues through every month of the year. Beginning with the first of January they start planning and working out new patterns and products for the next Christmas sales. There are still many more women who would like to weave but the present number is all that can be taken care of by the present weaving and Arrow-craft staffs. Both departments are working now to full capacity and it will be necessary after another year or two to discuss future development. The remarkable growth and development of the weaving department the past four years shows how efficient Winogene Redding has been and what a loss the school will sustain by her leaving. She has a thorough knowledge of her work and a most sympathetic understanding of the women with whom she has dealings and they have responded to all instruction and ad-vice remarkably well.

The shop handles quite a good many finished articles as well as the unfinished stools and chairs. Although our main broom maker moved where he could "see the trucks pass all day and hear them of a night" other makers have been developed so we still.can supply the demand. The Gift Shop is not open on Sundays, to the dismay of a great many Pi Phis as well as other tourists, but we have felt we should take this stand. Last fall new price lists were printed and this spring an attractive cut has been made for all Arrow-craft products. The expense of the Arrowcraft Shop, the weaving department, part of the office expense, and extra help necessary during the rush season is met by the industrial department and we feel sure that all this considered there will be a profit again this year. But were we able to only come out even we would feel it all worth while. The $22,000 in cash paid all these weavers, basket, furniture and broom makers, quilters, hookers, and tufters means a real livelihood to one hundred families. Clubs and shop have been able to work together better than ever before each having a better under-standing of the needs of the other. No other school I know of has the splendid market we have and we surely value it most highly. All we REPORTS OF OFFICERS 81 have said concerning splendid club cooperation is sincere. ADMINISTRATION AND PUBLICITY Again, in this department as well as others, the same policies have been followed as in the year previous. The Gatlinburg News has been sent out each month to many local people, all officers of the fraternity, to each settlement chairman of the clubs, to those on the isolated alum-n lists, and to a good many individuals. With this has gone a let-ter from the school telling of the various departments and activities. These letters have also gone to the active chapters. An effort has been made to keep the letters short enough to be read easily and quickly at club and chapter meetings. With the increased business of the Arrowcraft there has been more and more to do in the office. A good many old accounts that have been on the books for years have been settled and the new accounts have been settled more promptly. The large business carried on and the tremendous amount of money necessarily advanced to maintain the department mean that we have had to have payments made more promptly than in former years. Clubs and individuals have responded splendily. Each year the student labor ac-counts are carried in a more business-like manner by both pupils and school and that again brings much added office work. The annual Mountain Workers Conference met in Knoxville the first week in April and a number of our staff attended some of the sessions at least. The conference isalways an inspiration and the contacts made with those from other schools is most helpful and pleasant. Following the conference we had the usual number of visitors to our school. In the fall I was in Berea four days, spending the entire time in observing work in various departments. Miss Cooke, Miss Allen, Miss Moore, and Mr. Mattil also visited Berea College. We received a great help in the line of publicity this year when Mr. and Mrs. Charles Rogers, of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, published and gave to the school for distribution, 10,000 copies of a leaflet telling of the history and activities of the school. This has met a long-felt need. COUNTY HEALTH UNIT Again I want to explain the way in which we cooperate with the county in the maintenance of a health unit. Instead of paying the nurse's salary directly to her it goes through the state health department, with appropriations from one other school in the county and from the county court. These funds are matched by state and federal funds, making a sufficient income for a county nurse, county health physician, and sanitary specialist these in addition to the nurses in the two schools. The state also furnishes free typhoid, smallpox, toxin-antitoxin serums, and other supplies. There is every promise of the best unit this year that we have ever had and the big objective for the year is sanitating the entire county. For this big task the state is furnishing additional assistance to the present staff.

The )f seeing that every home, , and church has a sanitary is a sufficient piece of work to keep two men busy for months to come. Yet sanitation is the thing needed and I believe that a reason-able amount of cooperation will come from the people. The additional appropriation from the county court is providing men for this extra work. Our nurse now has a car, the state paying the upkeep of it. While a car will not take the place of a horse it many times saves a great deal of time and hard riding and with so many better roads seems a necessity. It also is a great convenience in taking patients to Knoxville for examination and treatment as the school truck is not always available nor very comfortable for trips of that kind. Six first year high school girls took the course in home nursing and care of the sick and received state certificates. During the summer Frances has organized two Little Mothers classes. These meet two afternoons each week and undoubtedly are the cutest things you ever saw. She gives the children instruction in how to care for their baby brothers and sisters and it is a course that some of the older ones might be proud to take. Two high school girls who had taken the home hygiene and care of the sick course assisted at the last tonsil clinic and demonstrated that their study had not been spent in vain. Two children were taken to the Trachoma Hospital for treatment and several others were given examinations. A Knoxville specialist gave two days for examining eyes and fitting glasses, saving us many hard trips to Knoxville with children. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 83 COMMUNITY It often seems that we do very little in real community work, yet we probably touch the people much more than we realize. Our crying need these days is a real social worker, one who can give Saturdays and Sundays to the young people who spend their time in the Burg with nothing to do. Library and reading room should be kept open. Books and magazines are here but no one with time enough to devote to keeping playrooms and reading rooms open. During the winter the auditorium was used by the community basket-ball team, Mr. Overton giving much of his time to their practice and games. There have been movies two nights each week since the first of May and they will continue through the summer. This year Arlie Watson and Ernest Reagan are the managers. It is difficult to always get the kind of films we want but on the whole the pictures are fairly good. Old Timers Day is one of the great events of the year, bringing many families in for a real get-together day. The Gatlinburg Fair continues to be the big day of the year. Between 500 and 600 school pupils from Gatlinburg and nearby communities join in the school parade and take part in athletic events during the day. The exhibits are of a high grade and truly "a good time is had by all." We believe it would be worth while to hold it two days in-stead of one. Our Christmas entertainment and tree, the plays during the school year always bring a house full of attentive people. It is our plan tohave more in the line of entertainment and educational addresses now that we have an auditorium. The university and state departments are always more than willing to be of help. Several teachers have had Sunday School classes and usually some at-tend the preaching services which now come twice a month instead of only once. The country church never does develop as fast as school and business do, unfortunately, yet there is a wonderful field waiting for someone to work in. Even though good roads and cars make it very easy for us and for the people here to take their recreation elsewhere we all feel that there is a great need for the home and community social life. EMMA HARPER TURNER CENTER SUGARLANDS The extension school and community work at Sugarlands continues to be one of our most interesting pieces of work. Emily Burton joined the Sugar-lands staff, after ten years in the Gatlinburg school. Eva Hathaway returned for her second year there. Mrs. Dowell left the Burg and be-came housemother and community worker in Sugarlands. These made a fine team. The two girls had the school work, and of course much community work too. Mrs. Dowell took care of the home, taught cooking and sewing, and helped with different outside things. In the winter Mrs. Dowell spent a week at the University of Tennessee for the farm women's short course and came back with plenty of ideas to work out with the local women. One was the making of rugs, hooked and braided.

The work in a small center is mighty interesting. You have your own home life with a small family, you come close to the people around you and it seems as though you can see more being accomplished from day to day than in a larger center. Perhaps we in Gatlinburg sometimes are a little envious. PERMANENT IMPROVEMENTS AND REPAIRS 1928-29 Stuart Cottage : reroof, laundry improved and heated, new water heater and tank installed, coal storage made.

The building and improvement program of the past two years has been a heavy one but it is pra.eti.. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 85 cally accomplished. It will take careful planning for another two years to get it all paid for and into anything like an easy financial condition but it will come and in the meantime we know that there will be the best possible response from clubs and chapters and we in turn will be as careful as possible of the expenditures here. Our school has never had many large gifts from individuals and even a building pro-gram is carried on largely from the regular donations of the year which make up the budget. No extra drives for funds have been made and it is a real accomplishment to have the new building as nearly paid for as it is under these circumstances. During the winter the treasury was in a most pitiful condition and it was necessary to give a cry of distress. It surely was answered and month by month funds have come in to keep us going but it continues to be a hard struggle for the treasurer. All are glad that this year is behind us and we can start on a new one. .A big task brings a challenge that no doubt is good for us all. Again I want to express my appreciation of the help that has come from officers, clubs, and chapters and for the splendid cooperation of each one on the staff. Each letter, each visit, and each check has helped more than you can realize. Respectfully submitted, EvELYN BISHOP ARROWCRAFT REPORT So much attention has been given in the past few years to the finding for and marketing of the Arrow-craft products that very little atten-tion has been given to those who make the products especially the furniture and basket makers. This past year things have been so organized that we have known bet-ter what we wanted the people to make. The clubs are becoming more familiar with the products and know better what they can and can-not sell. Their orders have come in earlier and they have been free in saying what they felt were best sellers. With every order there has been much correspondence which we feel sure has resulted in better understanding between the clubs and the shop and has been of in-valuable help in timely final settlements. By appealing to the people's pride we have been able to bring up the standards of the baskets. They are beginning to realize they are only hurting themselves when they make a poor basket. When.two or three arrive at the same time you can always hear them criticising one another's baskets bragging on the good points at times but more often pointing out the bad ones. In this way I feel they have helped one another more than we could ever have, regardless of how much we might have talked and scolded. I believe that Mr. Mattil's shop has done more to bring up the standard of the furniture than any-thing ever has or ever could have done. For over two years I talked seasoned wood, sand paper, and, a lot of care in making but I didn't get very far. After Mr. Mattil started his shop I had some things finished to use as samples. The furniture makers seemed amazed to think the things they made "just old common settin' chairs" could be made to look so pretty. One comment THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI : "I 'low that's pretty enough t in anybody's house." It Lied that they always had the that furniture was just rough f that didn't matter much and re wasn't any need in spending t of time on it. One of the best :ers seemed very interested in ing out how it was done, spend-an entire morning asking ques-.s. My curiosity was aroused so ;ked him what he was planning .o. Then he told me he was maksome black walnut chairs for [self and was going to finish n. I felt then that something really been accomplished. Just long we will be able to get the kets and chairs no one knows as 1y of the people have sold out the Park and of course that ins they can no longer cut the )d. here is just one woman and her ghter that do the tufting on the [I mats and bed spreads. She ught her first things to the Shop rly two years ago and they were ful attempts. She appealed to s's sympathy and by encouraging [ suggestions as to colors, etc., we re been able to help her until now one could ask for lovelier things n those she brings in. Ve have had our first quilts this r and have been very fortunate vetting them. Instead of starting h an inexperienced person we re begun with a master quilter. s. Hatcher and her mother-in-., from Wears Valley, do the Ming and I have never seen love-. We have only the full bed size its but hope to eventually work aby crib covers, comforts, etc. hrough Mrs. Dowell's effort we .e had a few hooked mats from Sugarlands. However, we hope to concentrate on braided rugs there and leave the hooking to the women who have been doing it for so long. We have never had any braided rugs but feel there is a market for them. The buying requires more time than it once did, for in these busy days we do not have the opportunity for home visiting and our greatest contact comes through the Shop visiting. This year we have had two exhibits at fairs one at the East Tennessee Division State Fair and one at the Tri-State Fair at Memphis. It was the first exhibit we had had at Knoxville of our industrial products. The fair association there, was not allowed to pay the expenses of the exhibit but did give us a premium of $75 which took care of all expenses. The alumnae club of Memphis had charge of the exhibit there (which was the fourth we have had) and bore all expenses. At both places a loom was used to demonstrate. At last we have a tag to mark all Arrowcraft products and one which everyone will like. I feel sure the clubs will welcome these. The price list was revised in the summer and this, with a letter of explanation and a club, or wholesale price list, was sent to each club in the fall. The circulars given to us by Mr. Rogers, of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, have been a world of help as hardly any-one comes into the Shop that doesn't want something that tells about the school. While the gross amount shipped isn't so much greater this year than last there has been less returned for credit. This is a result of smaller orders to more clubs. To date the gross sales have been REPORTS OF OFFICERS 87 $26,201.55 returned for credit $5,981.18. Net business $20,220.37. To ninety-eight people bringing things to the Shop we have paid $22,374.53, an average of $228.31 to each person. Taking the fifty weavers out and the $6,711.59 paid them, it leaves forty-eight basket makers, broom tyers, furniture makers, hookers, tufters and quilters receiving a total of $15,662.94. Everything recommended last year has been carried out with the exception of the water and toilet facilities in the Shop. With so many other improvements being made there never seemed to be a time when the necessary labor was available. We expect to get this done during the summer. There is only one recommendation I feel should be made this year. That is for a Shop in the new Mountain View Hotel which is to be erected this coming winter. I have talked to Mr. Huff about it and he says there is a space in the hotel for such a shop as we would want and that as long as the school is here and wants the space no one else shall have it. I feel sure the space can be leased for a nominal sum. We know that we are not getting our share of the tourist trade and this shop may be a possible solution. There are pros and cons that will need to be carefully discussed at committee meeting. Respectfully submitted, LADELLE ALLEN WEAVING REPORT Another year has come and gone and it is time once more for an annual report. This year I feel as if somethingdefinite has been accomplished among the women of the community. It is hard to put into words, as it is more a feeling of satisfaction that the educational goal that I have been striving toward for four years is in sight at last, than it is a condition that can be seen or expressed in so many sentences. It may be due in part to knowing the women more thoroughly, realizing the shortcomings of each woman and so knowing just how to handle the individual cases in order to give everyone the weaving help best suited to make her happy and satisfied. This only comes from long acquaintance and congenial workers. Working conditions are ideal now and have helped wonderfully to make the work run smoothly. The office, supply room, and large weaving room are in constant use. Sup-plies can be kept in better condition and more easily handled, saving much time. The office makes a convenient and necessary place for the women to bring in their weaving, and get material and receive directions for their weekly weaving. The class room is used the year around: for classes during the school year; several women use the warping bars and it gives a place where the women of the en-tire community can gather for group instruction, a most necessary part of the work, and until this year not available because of lack of space. I have found that the women respond enthusiastically to group instruction and the few meetings we have been able to hold have made the women much more independent in a technical way. They are gradually becoming more expert in the mechanics of weaving due to the rigid campaign held throughout THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI ar for looms in perfect work--Eder and the emphasis put on trly stages of warping, beamnd threading.

This [ am giving the weaving only. From June 1, 1928, to May 17, 1929, we have bought from the women $6,711.59 worth of weaving. More women have their own warping bars so only fifty-nine warps have been made on the school bars. Between September 18, 1928, and December 15, 1928, and February 11, 1929, and May 17, 1929, there have been 621 calls on weaving business only and I have made 117 calls in the homes. The school class was successful. Alice McCarter taught the class practical weaving and I gave the notebook work. There were seven in the class, seventh and eighth grade girls. They paid for the materials they used by weaving towels and selling them to the school. Alice helped me in many other ways and proved to be a valuable assistant. I have tried to spread out the weaving among more families by limiting each home to one loom and keeping the weaving in Gatlinburg and vicinity. There are four young girls weaving this summer to earn money to go to high school next fall, making a total of fifty weavers this year. From my experience I believe that to supervise fifty women and to visit fifty homes located in various degrees of distance and accessibility is all that one person can do successfully. The work seems to be at a good place to pass on to someone else. There have been the usual amount of trials and tribulations, jealousy among the weavers, etc., but I have enjoyed my work here to the utmost and I regret that I have to give it up.

Overton and the Sugar-:aff have pursued the same .t course of instruction as Lr. Every teacher has her rtificate so we are assured ler rating. Miss Kibler is academic teacher who will .ern to us and we lose her ret. The plan at the Sugar-E having two teachers and a housekeeper who does a great deal of community work has proved very satisfactory. Among the special teachers we are sorry to report several resignations, each of them an extremely difficult place to fill. No other one person could do for us all that Mr. Mattil has done in his eight years at the school, and we owe him an enormous debt of gratitude not only for the work he has accomplished but for his unfailing interest and loyalty. Miss Redding's work is probably more widely known to the fraternity in general than that of any other teacher, for it is she who de-signs the lovely and original things sent out from the Arrowcraft Shop each year and who has so painstakingly instructed the mountain people in order to produce articles of such a high degree of artistic and technical excellence. She has trained so thoroughly some of her apter pupils, and too, Miss Allen, who runs the Shop, has worked so closely and sympathetically with her that there will be no diminution from the high standards she has set, but her position is a hard one to fill and we shall miss her keenly. The work of Mrs. Farmer, the home economics teacher, is not so widely known, but it has had a strong influence in the community itself. One outstanding example of her ability was the remodeling and furnishing under her supervision and from materials at hand of a mountain cabin which won second prize in a national better homes competition. The writeup and pictures of this in THE ARROW have given you some idea of the splendid influence such work has in the community and how much of a loss her REPORTS OF OFFICERS 71 resignation means to us. Mrs. Farmer represents a truly Panhellenic spirit, for she is a Chi Omega and we have never had a teacher more devoted to the interests of the school. The health center was handicapped for several months by not having a nurse, but since November the position has been ably filled by Frances Moore, and the plans undertaken by the county for next year give promise of better results than ever before. During the frequent periods in the last three years when we have been without a nurse, Lillie Reagan, a Gatlinburg girl who assists at the health center, has tided over the intervals by helping the doctors who held clinics and doing some nursing, and to her we owe the fact that this valuable work has not been al-lowed to lapse over long periods but has been kept in such good condition that a new nurse could quickly pick up the threads without having to waste time in reorganization. This training of latent, native ability is one of the most vital results of our work at Gatlinburg and we are proud of every example of it which comes back like bread cast upon the waters. There are many who have gone out to other schools and communities, many who raise the standard of living conditions in Gatlinburg, and in the school itself, beside Lillie Reagan are Cora Mc-Carter, who until last year taught in the Sugarlands, Otha Reagan who supervises the student labor, and Arlie Watson who has substituted during Otha's long illness this spring, Ernest Reagan, who does all the odd jobs of repairing, electric lighting, etc., Alice McCarter, who has taught weaving in the school, Veatress Parton, who has helped in the Arrowcraft Shop; the three or four girls who have cooked at different times; and the dormitory girls and boys who do much of the work about the house and farm. Miss Bishop has as always con-ducted the many problems of ad-ministration with the tact and wisdom which endear her to everyone with whom she has contact and make her service to the fraternity of incalculable value. Her report will give you all the interesting de-tails which this summary lacks. Work with the committee this year has been an inspiration and pleasure and I sincerely regret that the completion of my four year term brings that close association to an end. The service of Edith Gordon and Blanche Curtis to the fraternity in other fields is already so well known, that I need not tell you how invaluable has been their work for the school, nor with what confidence and satisfaction I turn over the du-ties of chairman to Dr. Gordon. Ethel Curryer's efficient work as treasurer is familiar to you all and the success of financing our heavy building program for the last two years is due to her skillful management. Marguerite Ellis last fall provided the slides and films with new containers and has supervised their journeys to Alpha, Delta, and Kappa provinces. She has managed a trying job splendidly. Dr. Gordon reports that letters were sent to isolated alumme in an effort to have them join the national alumnae organization and to interest them in work for the school, but as the replies were sent to the province vice presidents, the response is not yet correlated. Mrs. Curtis has pre-pared the Little Pigeon articles for THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI BROW and sent a letter of to each club and chapter for :-ibution. Through these let-m the committee, the month-, and Gatlinburg News from ool, and frequent bulletins Le Arrowcraft Shop, a close aication with many members fraternity has been main constructive help and pleas-tact with Grand Council and 1 officers has been greatly apd and enjoyed. re again grateful to Mr. Col-r insurance agent, for a sub-gift to the school, and also and Mrs. Rogers of Mt. It, Iowa, for the gift of five thousand of the leaflets of information which are available at this convention. And for the help, cooperation, and generous contributions from the fraternity at large the committee gives its most grateful thanks. We are particularly glad to note the in-creasing number of contributions which come in around Christmas time, and if every club and chapter could realize what worry it saves the treasurer to have money coming in during the lean months of December, January, and February, when expenditures are very heavy, we are sure the custom would be-come universal. GERTRUDE B. FREEMAN Report of Director of Settlement School 'riting a report of the past am impressed with the fact has been one of completing, as possible, projects already rather than a year of new While this is in many ways story it does lack, the thrill work and the finishing tasks edious and hard when they so many months. structure of the new building Tactically completed by the Le new term started in Aug-: the heating, plumbing, and were yet to be put in. The t task came with the building power house. It had been I that a central heating sys-)uld be put in now, the school gs being put on the same sysonce, and plans laid for add-her cottages to it when it wise. This came after the building program of the ro years, when we were corn-worn out with that kind ofwork and worry. Excavating for the power house brought other problems if the dirt and rock blasted out of that hole, twenty feet by forty feet by eleven feet, was to be used for building up our roads, the lanes must be tiled first. Ditches of appalling depth had to be dug all over the place and it seemed all winter that we never would be cleared up and smoothed over again. By spring things were very nearly graded and seeded down and we felt that we had buried a world of troubles in each of those ditches. The next year should be a much easier one. While it is a regret to bring coal soot and smoke into our lovely mountains we do keep much more comfortable than in the days when even green wood was hard to get. Can it be possible that we now use two carloads of coal, in addition to all the fire and stove wood? Practically the same program has REPORTS OF OFFICERS 73 been followed in every department. No radical changes have occurred anywhere. Yet in some ways it has been one of the most difficult years we have had. No doubt the fact that for the past six months there has not been a single day when every member of the staff has been able to be on duty has called for real effort to keep up the morale. The flu epidemic which came before Christmas and lasted all winter had not released its hold on some of the family when school closed in the spring. In addition to this it has been a year when trying repairs be-came necessary. Difficulties with the water system, unsatisfactory electric current, and other almost daily troubles had to be met. Last year I mentioned the pro-posed Smoky Mountain National Park. At present it seems as though the "land sale" methods used during the winter have stopped and we hope people back in the hollows will not be too hasty in moving away. Our immediate territory has not been seriously affected. Even the Sugarlands has almost as many families still living there, although eventually that section is sure to be in the park boundary. Until the large timber tracts can be purchased the state cannot turn the land over to the government. When this really becomes a park is more than we can say and in the meantime there is no reason why we should not continue calmly on. Already a road through the Sugarlands to the top of the Smoky Mountain range is graded and with-in three or four months will be in condition for cars to go the entire way and it is a most beautiful drive to the North Carolina line. I regret that a list has not beenkept of the visiting Pi Phis for scarcely a day goes by, winter or summer, that one or more do not come. Many stay for a few hours ; some get only to the Arrowcraft Shop; others take time enough to see the whole place and even make a quick trip to Sugarlands (for quick trips there are now possible). We surely enjoy and appreciate these visits and we only hope those coming receive as much pleasure and inspiration as their visits give us. And Washington and Niagara Falls are not the only places sometimes I think Gatlinburg bids fair to be a Pi Phi honeymoon resort. The staff has been: Evelyn Bishop, director. W. B. Overton, principal, junior high teacher. Kathefine Kibler, junior high teacher. Alice Williams, fifth and sixth grades. Henrietta McCutchan, third and fourth grades. Eleanor Brabson, primer, first and second grades. O. J. Mattil, Smith Hughes agriculture. Katherine Katson Farmer, Smith Hughes home economics. Winogene Redding, weaving.

SCHOOL n spite of the confusion caused the unfinished building and so ch sickness, we feel we can re-'t a more than usually successful :he total enrollment was 168--:nty-six of that number were in t and second year high school. Vlr. Overton had accomplished much the year previous in seing certificates, rating, etc., for school that the new year started much easier. Every teacher had state certificate at the opening school and there were no doubts )ut the rating with the state de--tment. dr. Overton and Miss Kibler had same classes as the year before, Overton taking all the mathetics for the seventh, eighth, ,th, and tenth grades and Miss )ler all the English. In the fall se classes were held in the new lding but as mornings grew cool y would be one day in the old 1 the next in the new. Finally it s necessary to go back into the quarters and stay there until heating system was completed January. Light pupils completed second Lr high school and all expect to enter some other school in the fall. While only three received eighth grade certificates the first year high school class will probably have the usual number as nearly all those pupils come from nearby schools but far enough away to make it necessary for them to be in the dormitory. Eleanor Brabson, Alice Williams, and Henrietta McCutchan made a splendid team and although they were here for the first time they found no difficulty in quickly adjusting themselves to their new work as they were three very efficient teachers. Alice had the fifth and sixth grades, Henrietta the third and fourth, and Eleanor the primary, first, and second. There is a real criticism that could be made and I hope before long we can consider a change. The three grades, primer, first, and second, have the largest enrollment and are in the same room under the same teacher. The year we had kindergarten work for the youngest ones was most satisfactory and I trust another year it will be possible for a budget allowance to provide again for this work. While the four upper grades have a nine months school term these others have only eight months. Henrietta. McCutchan and Mr. Overton coached the basketball teams and, as many of the pupils had never seen a game before coming here, it meant starting from the beginning. After getting into the new building light practice was made compulsory for all seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth grade boys and girls. The teams entered the East Tennessee high school tournament and although we were the only two year high school entrant our pupils made a very creditable show REPORTS OF OFFICERS ing. Another year both Mr. Over-ton and Miss McCutchan hope to do more along the line of supervised play. The usual plays and social affairs were given during the year and in whatever was done the cooperation was unusually good. We are sorry to have Miss Kibler leave this spring and very glad the other grade teachers will re-turn. All three special teachers are leaving this year, Mr. Mattil, Katherine Farmer, and Winogene Red-ding and the places will be hard to fill. Of the eight pupils completing second year high last year six have been in school this year, one in Newport High, one in Maryville High, three in Sevierville High, and one in Murphy Institute. The other two have been working this year to earn money to enter school next fall. Mrs. Duffield and Mrs. Gilbert, both former music teachers and now living in Gatlinburg, have given mu-sic lessons to quite a number of pupils but there has been no pul)lic school music taught in the school. This is always a regret as there is such a wonderful opportunity to develop this native talent. This year shows a still better reimbursement from the county for maintaining the eight grades of the day school, due to all teachers having state professional certificates. The county has paid us the past year for teachers and fuel $3,318. This does not include any of the state funds allowed us for agriculture, weaving, and home economics. The class work in agriculture, home economics, and weaving is incorporated into the reports of those departments. HoME EcoNomics The usual home economics cla; were held for first and second y high school girls; each class hav two periods every morning. W their work follows the state cot and has the same laboratory textbook work, girls here have m practical experience than usuall possible in a high school.

The evening school prograrr planned a year ago never did terialize. Instead of coming tc in January for full time ever school work, Jean Steele was to Elizabethton. Because of the dustrial situation there large n hers of mountain people had me into the town and presented a for work that only one with ex ence and ability could handle. state department felt that Jean the best one for the place. Katherine Watson devoted p tically all of her time to reg school work home economics science classes. They kept her f having time for evening sc work although she did manag get in one afternoon class each ti and the latter part of the year in one night class. Two intensive sewing c12 were held by Mrs. Zuccarellc the state department, and the di making done during those w was nothing short of ama; THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI ese courses were financed partly the state and partly by those ing the course. The exhibit at Gatlinburg Fair showed what week of sewing had accornshed. The home economics work closed the year at the end of the school m, no community classes being -ried on during the vacation. ks Katherine Watson married we a vacancy to fill at the end of school year. Miss Mary Rachel mstrong, University of Tenneswill take Katherine's place and, less present plans fail, will devote 7 entire time to home economics : cool classes in the morning and nmunity classes in the afternoon. already a full program is being rked out for the new year and we ill be glad to again take up these nmunity classes that we feel are very worth while. SGRICULTURE AND FARM SHOP [n writing a report of this departnt we have to remember that Mr. ittil has had so many different es of work outside of school rou e that we wonder he has been e to accomplish one-half that he n Smith Hughes agriculture !re is a school program that takes morning, each class having two -iods every day. This corre-)nds to the home economics pro-Lm. The afternoons should be en over to community work such junior poultry clubs, spraying pruning of orchards, advising stock and crops, veterinary ad e and treatment, and in fact do-; about everything called for. e shop work is along the line practical farm aid, making wag-beds and wheel barrows, self feeders for chickens and pigs, harness repairing, care of tools, etc. Each boy from the seventh grade up has a home project which he keeps an accurate record of, under the supervision of the teacher. These are varied. Some boys take a pig for a project, some a cow, others have crop projects. Many take poultry. The past two years the building program and other improvements have taken much of Mr. Mattil's time as he has supervised all these. It has been a real regret to him and to us that the educational work in nearby communities where he had had clubs and classes had to be dropped for this but no person could have handled both. In addition to these there is the farm to supervise and the student labor to keep in touch with. After seven years spent in organizing and building up this department Mr. Mattil feels he must give up teaching. We will have a hard task to fill his place, in fact shall not try to find anyone who can shoulder so much. He has done an outstanding piece of work which is recognized and appreciated by all. With the beginning of the new school year we shall go back to a distinct school program in this department, endeavoring to keep the outside things entirely separate from the work that rightfully be-longs to this department. For a year or more Mr. Mattil has been carrying on a very interesting piece of work independent of the school, yet somewhat associated with it too. The demands for antiques were so insistent he finally fitted up the old barn, near the school building, as a shop; putting an electric system and motors, REPORTS OF OFFICERS wood working machinery, etc., and employed from one to five boys to refinish old furniture and reproduce crickets, book shelves, tables, and in fact many different kinds of things which are sold in. the Arrow-craft Shop. The training these boys have had in the shop has been of the best and we only hope that Mr. Mattil has been able to at least come out even financially with the proposition. There is no doubt but that this has had a great influence on the furniture makers of the community for they are now bringing in better furniture than ever before. I am sure that eventually the school will want to take this over but at the present time we are only too glad to have Mr. Mattil want to keep it. FARM AND STUDENT LABOR The report of the farm and of the student labor is most satisfactory. More has been raised in the garden for the table, stock well cared for, fields in better condition, the place showing improvement generally. We are asked many times what we keep on the farm. We have three horses, one for farm work, two for the nurse and teachers. Four cows, one registered heifer gotten this past year, a registered Jersey bull, five Berkshire hogs, Barred Rock poultry, two Shropshire sheep gotten this year. About 100 hens are kept during the win-ter. At present we have nearly 1,000 little chicks, some to keep, most to be sold during the summer for ' fryers. Our incubators and brooders do service for the whole community. The farm and the student laboris all looked after by Otha Rea under the supervision and plann of Mr. Mattil. Otha is a ma: hand with the boys and as he been here a long time he is tl~ oughly familiar with Mr. Mat methods and can take a great of responsibility. Otha has b away because of illness for the five months and the work has b done by a former dormitory who has shown himself very c able. Having dormitory boys 1 year who had been here some t. has been a great help for all h shown themselves so very depe able and willing during this h siege. DORMITORIES Each year we are more fully c winced that the time and money u in supervising and providing a home life for our students who too far from the school to walk b and forth is well spent. The year we have had from six to boys and from eight to twelve g in the dormitories. Each stud has had regular hours of labor practically have had to look out all school expenses without any from home. Three boys had homes so their problems were larger ; how to earn enough fo new pair of overalls or shirt c hair cut in addition to all other penses. More than half of the mitory students finished their w here this spring so these places be filled this fall by new pupils. We have been most fortunat, having Mrs. Morgan in the g dormitory and to take care of meals for all this large family Iv] numbers now from thirty-five forty-five all the time.

Due to in family in the past few .e septic tank built ten years ago is inadequate and a new one must be put in this summer with new sewage lines. That will also be done by our men here. Mother made the move from the girls' to the boys' dormitory last fall and found the boys as nice to deal with as the girls. Discipline in either dormitory is not difficult but when one is willing and interested she can find plenty to do at either place and that kind of work requires being constantly with it. The past year two rooms in the teachers' cottage have been used by the boys, one for a dressing and wash room, one for a clubroom. The cottage in which they lived was too far for them to get to during the day. This summer we have rented the Jim Reagan cottage, which ad-joins our property and is near enough for all the needs of the boys. While the cottage is small the lo-cation so near the school will repay any other inconveniences they may have. The same schedule of work has been held to this year as last, the girls getting experience in practically every kind of work pertaining to homemaking, the boys in every-thing relating to stock and farm as well as general repair and up-keep work. LOCAL LABOR Not only the student labor but all the outside work has been done more satisfactorily the past year than ever before. Arlie Watson has taken care of furnaces and odd tasks during the winter, during the spring and summer has had a wonderful garden (which i used to supply our tables and also families who live in the Burg during the summer) and of course kept up many other duties. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 79 He and Otha Reagan make a fine team. Ernest Reagan continues to be with us and is the man for wiring, plumbing, repairing anything and everything. Two local girls who received some training in the evening class in home economics have done the cooking. Lillie Reagan continues as the nurse's assistant. We have eight local people on the pay roll and are proud of every one of them. WEAVING Again we can report continued growth in this department. While there have been the usual number of new products added to the Shop, things beautiful and decidedly sale-able, there has been a marked development in the real knowledge of the mechanics and art of weaving among the women. It has taken great effort to keep the weaving divided as equally and evenly among the people as possible and during the year forty-six women wove for the school, also four high school girls earned money in this way to continue school next year. Supervising weaving in fifty homes is a full-time task but the products show how well it is done. In addition to the individual instruction there have been six group meetings, with from sixteen to thirty women in attendance. These are possible since the new weaving room is finished. The new weaving, office, and storage rooms are almost too good to be true, and have relieved the stress" and strain in that department and other places too. Last spring the Smith Hughes vocational funds reimbursed us for the instruction given the afternoon class of women and with this money we employed Alice McCarter thisyear as assistant to Miss Redding. Alice is one of our local girls who has woven for us for years and is called the "loom doctor" because of being so expert in diagnosing and treating loom troubles of all kinds. I am glad to report that once again we have our regular classes in weaving for our school girls. The seventh and eighth grade girls have had two periods each day during the year, Alice and Miss Red-ding doing the teaching. Four new looms were gotten before school opened and three others rebuilt. With new weaving room and new looms, the results were most satisfactory. We are expecting reimbursement from the state again and hope that Alice will be able to continue her work another year. Weaving in the homes continues through every month of the year. Beginning with the first of January they start planning and working out new patterns and products for the next Christmas sales. There are still many more women who would like to weave but the present number is all that can be taken care of by the present weaving and Arrow-craft staffs. Both departments are working now to full capacity and it will be necessary after another year or two to discuss future development. The remarkable growth and development of the weaving department the past four years shows how efficient Winogene Redding has been and what a loss the school will sustain by her leaving. She has a thorough knowledge of her work and a most sympathetic understanding of the women with whom she has dealings and they have responded to all instruction and ad-vice remarkably well.

Mr. Mattil's shop, where finishing is done, has shown the local men such a marked difference between indifferently made furniture and that made from well seasoned wood, carefully put together and sanded and ready to be finished, that the men themselves have made marked progress in their work. The shop handles quite a good many finished articles as well as the unfinished stools and chairs. Although our main broom maker moved where he could "see the trucks pass all day and hear them of a night" other makers have been developed so we still.can supply the demand. The Gift Shop is not open on Sundays, to the dismay of a great many Pi Phis as well as other tourists, but we have felt we should take this stand. Last fall new price lists were printed and this spring an attractive cut has been made for all Arrow-craft products. The expense of the Arrowcraft Shop, the weaving department, part of the office expense, and extra help necessary during the rush season is met by the industrial department and we feel sure that all this considered there will be a profit again this year. But were we able to only come out even we would feel it all worth while. The $22,000 in cash paid all these weavers, basket, furniture and broom makers, quilters, hookers, and tufters means a real livelihood to one hundred families. Clubs and shop have been able to work together better than ever before each having a better under-standing of the needs of the other. No other school I know of has the splendid market we have and we surely value it most highly. All we REPORTS OF OFFICERS 81 have said concerning splendid club cooperation is sincere. ADMINISTRATION AND PUBLICITY Again, in this department as well as others, the same policies have been followed as in the year previous. The Gatlinburg News has been sent out each month to many local people, all officers of the fraternity, to each settlement chairman of the clubs, to those on the isolated alum-n lists, and to a good many individuals. With this has gone a let-ter from the school telling of the various departments and activities. These letters have also gone to the active chapters. An effort has been made to keep the letters short enough to be read easily and quickly at club and chapter meetings. With the increased business of the Arrowcraft there has been more and more to do in the office. A good many old accounts that have been on the books for years have been settled and the new accounts have been settled more promptly. The large business carried on and the tremendous amount of money necessarily advanced to maintain the department mean that we have had to have payments made more promptly than in former years. Clubs and individuals have responded splendily. Each year the student labor ac-counts are carried in a more business-like manner by both pupils and school and that again brings much added office work. The annual Mountain Workers Conference met in Knoxville the first week in April and a number of our staff attended some of the sessions at least. The conference isalways an inspiration and the contacts made with those from other schools is most helpful and pleasant. Following the conference we had the usual number of visitors to our school. In the fall I was in Berea four days, spending the entire time in observing work in various departments. Miss Cooke, Miss Allen, Miss Moore, and Mr. Mattil also visited Berea College. We received a great help in the line of publicity this year when Mr. and Mrs. Charles Rogers, of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, published and gave to the school for distribution, 10,000 copies of a leaflet telling of the history and activities of the school. This has met a long-felt need. COUNTY HEALTH UNIT Again I want to explain the way in which we cooperate with the county in the maintenance of a health unit. Instead of paying the nurse's salary directly to her it goes through the state health department, with appropriations from one other school in the county and from the county court. These funds are matched by state and federal funds, making a sufficient income for a county nurse, county health physician, and sanitary specialist these in addition to the nurses in the two schools. The state also furnishes free typhoid, smallpox, toxin-antitoxin serums, and other supplies. There is every promise of the best unit this year that we have ever had and the big objective for the year is sanitating the entire county. For this big task the state is furnishing additional assistance to the present staff.

The )f seeing that every home, , and church has a sanitary is a sufficient piece of work to keep two men busy for months to come. Yet sanitation is the thing needed and I believe that a reason-able amount of cooperation will come from the people. The additional appropriation from the county court is providing men for this extra work. Our nurse now has a car, the state paying the upkeep of it. While a car will not take the place of a horse it many times saves a great deal of time and hard riding and with so many better roads seems a necessity. It also is a great convenience in taking patients to Knoxville for examination and treatment as the school truck is not always available nor very comfortable for trips of that kind. Six first year high school girls took the course in home nursing and care of the sick and received state certificates. During the summer Frances has organized two Little Mothers classes. These meet two afternoons each week and undoubtedly are the cutest things you ever saw. She gives the children instruction in how to care for their baby brothers and sisters and it is a course that some of the older ones might be proud to take. Two high school girls who had taken the home hygiene and care of the sick course assisted at the last tonsil clinic and demonstrated that their study had not been spent in vain. Two children were taken to the Trachoma Hospital for treatment and several others were given examinations. A Knoxville specialist gave two days for examining eyes and fitting glasses, saving us many hard trips to Knoxville with children. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 83 COMMUNITY It often seems that we do very little in real community work, yet we probably touch the people much more than we realize. Our crying need these days is a real social worker, one who can give Saturdays and Sundays to the young people who spend their time in the Burg with nothing to do. Library and reading room should be kept open. Books and magazines are here but no one with time enough to devote to keeping playrooms and reading rooms open. During the winter the auditorium was used by the community basket-ball team, Mr. Overton giving much of his time to their practice and games. There have been movies two nights each week since the first of May and they will continue through the summer. This year Arlie Watson and Ernest Reagan are the managers. It is difficult to always get the kind of films we want but on the whole the pictures are fairly good. Old Timers Day is one of the great events of the year, bringing many families in for a real get-together day. The Gatlinburg Fair continues to be the big day of the year. Between 500 and 600 school pupils from Gatlinburg and nearby communities join in the school parade and take part in athletic events during the day. The exhibits are of a high grade and truly "a good time is had by all." We believe it would be worth while to hold it two days in-stead of one. Our Christmas entertainment and tree, the plays during the school year always bring a house full of attentive people. It is our plan tohave more in the line of entertainment and educational addresses now that we have an auditorium. The university and state departments are always more than willing to be of help. Several teachers have had Sunday School classes and usually some at-tend the preaching services which now come twice a month instead of only once. The country church never does develop as fast as school and business do, unfortunately, yet there is a wonderful field waiting for someone to work in. Even though good roads and cars make it very easy for us and for the people here to take their recreation elsewhere we all feel that there is a great need for the home and community social life. EMMA HARPER TURNER CENTER SUGARLANDS The extension school and community work at Sugarlands continues to be one of our most interesting pieces of work. Emily Burton joined the Sugar-lands staff, after ten years in the Gatlinburg school. Eva Hathaway returned for her second year there. Mrs. Dowell left the Burg and be-came housemother and community worker in Sugarlands. These made a fine team. The two girls had the school work, and of course much community work too. Mrs. Dowell took care of the home, taught cooking and sewing, and helped with different outside things. In the winter Mrs. Dowell spent a week at the University of Tennessee for the farm women's short course and came back with plenty of ideas to work out with the local women. One was the making of rugs, hooked and braided.

The work in a small center is mighty interesting. You have your own home life with a small family, you come close to the people around you and it seems as though you can see more being accomplished from day to day than in a larger center. Perhaps we in Gatlinburg sometimes are a little envious. PERMANENT IMPROVEMENTS AND REPAIRS 1928-29 Stuart Cottage : reroof, laundry improved and heated, new water heater and tank installed, coal storage made.

The building and improvement program of the past two years has been a heavy one but it is pra.eti.. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 85 cally accomplished. It will take careful planning for another two years to get it all paid for and into anything like an easy financial condition but it will come and in the meantime we know that there will be the best possible response from clubs and chapters and we in turn will be as careful as possible of the expenditures here. Our school has never had many large gifts from individuals and even a building pro-gram is carried on largely from the regular donations of the year which make up the budget. No extra drives for funds have been made and it is a real accomplishment to have the new building as nearly paid for as it is under these circumstances. During the winter the treasury was in a most pitiful condition and it was necessary to give a cry of distress. It surely was answered and month by month funds have come in to keep us going but it continues to be a hard struggle for the treasurer. All are glad that this year is behind us and we can start on a new one. .A big task brings a challenge that no doubt is good for us all. Again I want to express my appreciation of the help that has come from officers, clubs, and chapters and for the splendid cooperation of each one on the staff. Each letter, each visit, and each check has helped more than you can realize. Respectfully submitted, EvELYN BISHOP ARROWCRAFT REPORT So much attention has been given in the past few years to the finding for and marketing of the Arrow-craft products that very little atten-tion has been given to those who make the products especially the furniture and basket makers. This past year things have been so organized that we have known bet-ter what we wanted the people to make. The clubs are becoming more familiar with the products and know better what they can and can-not sell. Their orders have come in earlier and they have been free in saying what they felt were best sellers. With every order there has been much correspondence which we feel sure has resulted in better understanding between the clubs and the shop and has been of in-valuable help in timely final settlements. By appealing to the people's pride we have been able to bring up the standards of the baskets. They are beginning to realize they are only hurting themselves when they make a poor basket. When.two or three arrive at the same time you can always hear them criticising one another's baskets bragging on the good points at times but more often pointing out the bad ones. In this way I feel they have helped one another more than we could ever have, regardless of how much we might have talked and scolded. I believe that Mr. Mattil's shop has done more to bring up the standard of the furniture than any-thing ever has or ever could have done. For over two years I talked seasoned wood, sand paper, and, a lot of care in making but I didn't get very far. After Mr. Mattil started his shop I had some things finished to use as samples. The furniture makers seemed amazed to think the things they made "just old common settin' chairs" could be made to look so pretty. One comment THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI : "I 'low that's pretty enough t in anybody's house." It Lied that they always had the that furniture was just rough f that didn't matter much and re wasn't any need in spending t of time on it. One of the best :ers seemed very interested in ing out how it was done, spend-an entire morning asking ques-.s. My curiosity was aroused so ;ked him what he was planning .o. Then he told me he was maksome black walnut chairs for [self and was going to finish n. I felt then that something really been accomplished. Just long we will be able to get the kets and chairs no one knows as 1y of the people have sold out the Park and of course that ins they can no longer cut the )d. here is just one woman and her ghter that do the tufting on the [I mats and bed spreads. She ught her first things to the Shop rly two years ago and they were ful attempts. She appealed to s's sympathy and by encouraging [ suggestions as to colors, etc., we re been able to help her until now one could ask for lovelier things n those she brings in. Ve have had our first quilts this r and have been very fortunate vetting them. Instead of starting h an inexperienced person we re begun with a master quilter. s. Hatcher and her mother-in-., from Wears Valley, do the Ming and I have never seen love-. We have only the full bed size its but hope to eventually work aby crib covers, comforts, etc. hrough Mrs. Dowell's effort we .e had a few hooked mats from Sugarlands. However, we hope to concentrate on braided rugs there and leave the hooking to the women who have been doing it for so long. We have never had any braided rugs but feel there is a market for them. The buying requires more time than it once did, for in these busy days we do not have the opportunity for home visiting and our greatest contact comes through the Shop visiting. This year we have had two exhibits at fairs one at the East Tennessee Division State Fair and one at the Tri-State Fair at Memphis. It was the first exhibit we had had at Knoxville of our industrial products. The fair association there, was not allowed to pay the expenses of the exhibit but did give us a premium of $75 which took care of all expenses. The alumnae club of Memphis had charge of the exhibit there (which was the fourth we have had) and bore all expenses. At both places a loom was used to demonstrate. At last we have a tag to mark all Arrowcraft products and one which everyone will like. I feel sure the clubs will welcome these. The price list was revised in the summer and this, with a letter of explanation and a club, or wholesale price list, was sent to each club in the fall. The circulars given to us by Mr. Rogers, of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, have been a world of help as hardly any-one comes into the Shop that doesn't want something that tells about the school. While the gross amount shipped isn't so much greater this year than last there has been less returned for credit. This is a result of smaller orders to more clubs. To date the gross sales have been REPORTS OF OFFICERS 87 $26,201.55 returned for credit $5,981.18. Net business $20,220.37. To ninety-eight people bringing things to the Shop we have paid $22,374.53, an average of $228.31 to each person. Taking the fifty weavers out and the $6,711.59 paid them, it leaves forty-eight basket makers, broom tyers, furniture makers, hookers, tufters and quilters receiving a total of $15,662.94. Everything recommended last year has been carried out with the exception of the water and toilet facilities in the Shop. With so many other improvements being made there never seemed to be a time when the necessary labor was available. We expect to get this done during the summer. There is only one recommendation I feel should be made this year. That is for a Shop in the new Mountain View Hotel which is to be erected this coming winter. I have talked to Mr. Huff about it and he says there is a space in the hotel for such a shop as we would want and that as long as the school is here and wants the space no one else shall have it. I feel sure the space can be leased for a nominal sum. We know that we are not getting our share of the tourist trade and this shop may be a possible solution. There are pros and cons that will need to be carefully discussed at committee meeting. Respectfully submitted, LADELLE ALLEN WEAVING REPORT Another year has come and gone and it is time once more for an annual report. This year I feel as if somethingdefinite has been accomplished among the women of the community. It is hard to put into words, as it is more a feeling of satisfaction that the educational goal that I have been striving toward for four years is in sight at last, than it is a condition that can be seen or expressed in so many sentences. It may be due in part to knowing the women more thoroughly, realizing the shortcomings of each woman and so knowing just how to handle the individual cases in order to give everyone the weaving help best suited to make her happy and satisfied. This only comes from long acquaintance and congenial workers. Working conditions are ideal now and have helped wonderfully to make the work run smoothly. The office, supply room, and large weaving room are in constant use. Sup-plies can be kept in better condition and more easily handled, saving much time. The office makes a convenient and necessary place for the women to bring in their weaving, and get material and receive directions for their weekly weaving. The class room is used the year around: for classes during the school year; several women use the warping bars and it gives a place where the women of the en-tire community can gather for group instruction, a most necessary part of the work, and until this year not available because of lack of space. I have found that the women respond enthusiastically to group instruction and the few meetings we have been able to hold have made the women much more independent in a technical way. They are gradually becoming more expert in the mechanics of weaving due to the rigid campaign held throughout THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI ar for looms in perfect work--Eder and the emphasis put on trly stages of warping, beamnd threading.

This [ am giving the weaving only. From June 1, 1928, to May 17, 1929, we have bought from the women $6,711.59 worth of weaving. More women have their own warping bars so only fifty-nine warps have been made on the school bars. Between September 18, 1928, and December 15, 1928, and February 11, 1929, and May 17, 1929, there have been 621 calls on weaving business only and I have made 117 calls in the homes. The school class was successful. Alice McCarter taught the class practical weaving and I gave the notebook work. There were seven in the class, seventh and eighth grade girls. They paid for the materials they used by weaving towels and selling them to the school. Alice helped me in many other ways and proved to be a valuable assistant. I have tried to spread out the weaving among more families by limiting each home to one loom and keeping the weaving in Gatlinburg and vicinity. There are four young girls weaving this summer to earn money to go to high school next fall, making a total of fifty weavers this year. From my experience I believe that to supervise fifty women and to visit fifty homes located in various degrees of distance and accessibility is all that one person can do successfully. The work seems to be at a good place to pass on to someone else. There have been the usual amount of trials and tribulations, jealousy among the weavers, etc., but I have enjoyed my work here to the utmost and I regret that I have to give it up. Respectfully submitted, WINOGENE B.

Through these let-m the committee, the month-, and Gatlinburg News from ool, and frequent bulletins Le Arrowcraft Shop, a close aication with many members fraternity has been main constructive help and pleas-tact with Grand Council and 1 officers has been greatly apd and enjoyed. re again grateful to Mr. Col-r insurance agent, for a sub-gift to the school, and also and Mrs. Rogers of Mt. It, Iowa, for the gift of five thousand of the leaflets of information which are available at this convention. And for the help, cooperation, and generous contributions from the fraternity at large the committee gives its most grateful thanks. We are particularly glad to note the in-creasing number of contributions which come in around Christmas time, and if every club and chapter could realize what worry it saves the treasurer to have money coming in during the lean months of December, January, and February, when expenditures are very heavy, we are sure the custom would be-come universal. GERTRUDE B. FREEMAN Report of Director of Settlement School 'riting a report of the past am impressed with the fact has been one of completing, as possible, projects already rather than a year of new While this is in many ways story it does lack, the thrill work and the finishing tasks edious and hard when they so many months. structure of the new building Tactically completed by the Le new term started in Aug-: the heating, plumbing, and were yet to be put in. The t task came with the building power house. It had been I that a central heating sys-)uld be put in now, the school gs being put on the same sysonce, and plans laid for add-her cottages to it when it wise. This came after the building program of the ro years, when we were corn-worn out with that kind ofwork and worry. Excavating for the power house brought other problems if the dirt and rock blasted out of that hole, twenty feet by forty feet by eleven feet, was to be used for building up our roads, the lanes must be tiled first. Ditches of appalling depth had to be dug all over the place and it seemed all winter that we never would be cleared up and smoothed over again. By spring things were very nearly graded and seeded down and we felt that we had buried a world of troubles in each of those ditches. The next year should be a much easier one. While it is a regret to bring coal soot and smoke into our lovely mountains we do keep much more comfortable than in the days when even green wood was hard to get. Can it be possible that we now use two carloads of coal, in addition to all the fire and stove wood? Practically the same program has REPORTS OF OFFICERS 73 been followed in every department. No radical changes have occurred anywhere. Yet in some ways it has been one of the most difficult years we have had. No doubt the fact that for the past six months there has not been a single day when every member of the staff has been able to be on duty has called for real effort to keep up the morale. The flu epidemic which came before Christmas and lasted all winter had not released its hold on some of the family when school closed in the spring. In addition to this it has been a year when trying repairs be-came necessary. Difficulties with the water system, unsatisfactory electric current, and other almost daily troubles had to be met. Last year I mentioned the pro-posed Smoky Mountain National Park. At present it seems as though the "land sale" methods used during the winter have stopped and we hope people back in the hollows will not be too hasty in moving away. Our immediate territory has not been seriously affected. Even the Sugarlands has almost as many families still living there, although eventually that section is sure to be in the park boundary. Until the large timber tracts can be purchased the state cannot turn the land over to the government. When this really becomes a park is more than we can say and in the meantime there is no reason why we should not continue calmly on. Already a road through the Sugarlands to the top of the Smoky Mountain range is graded and with-in three or four months will be in condition for cars to go the entire way and it is a most beautiful drive to the North Carolina line. I regret that a list has not beenkept of the visiting Pi Phis for scarcely a day goes by, winter or summer, that one or more do not come. Many stay for a few hours ; some get only to the Arrowcraft Shop; others take time enough to see the whole place and even make a quick trip to Sugarlands (for quick trips there are now possible). We surely enjoy and appreciate these visits and we only hope those coming receive as much pleasure and inspiration as their visits give us. And Washington and Niagara Falls are not the only places sometimes I think Gatlinburg bids fair to be a Pi Phi honeymoon resort. The staff has been: Evelyn Bishop, director. W. B. Overton, principal, junior high teacher. Kathefine Kibler, junior high teacher. Alice Williams, fifth and sixth grades. Henrietta McCutchan, third and fourth grades. Eleanor Brabson, primer, first and second grades. O. J. Mattil, Smith Hughes agriculture. Katherine Katson Farmer, Smith Hughes home economics. Winogene Redding, weaving.

SCHOOL n spite of the confusion caused the unfinished building and so ch sickness, we feel we can re-'t a more than usually successful :he total enrollment was 168--:nty-six of that number were in t and second year high school. Vlr. Overton had accomplished much the year previous in seing certificates, rating, etc., for school that the new year started much easier. Every teacher had state certificate at the opening school and there were no doubts )ut the rating with the state de--tment. dr. Overton and Miss Kibler had same classes as the year before, Overton taking all the mathetics for the seventh, eighth, ,th, and tenth grades and Miss )ler all the English. In the fall se classes were held in the new lding but as mornings grew cool y would be one day in the old 1 the next in the new. Finally it s necessary to go back into the quarters and stay there until heating system was completed January. Light pupils completed second Lr high school and all expect to enter some other school in the fall. While only three received eighth grade certificates the first year high school class will probably have the usual number as nearly all those pupils come from nearby schools but far enough away to make it necessary for them to be in the dormitory. Eleanor Brabson, Alice Williams, and Henrietta McCutchan made a splendid team and although they were here for the first time they found no difficulty in quickly adjusting themselves to their new work as they were three very efficient teachers. Alice had the fifth and sixth grades, Henrietta the third and fourth, and Eleanor the primary, first, and second. There is a real criticism that could be made and I hope before long we can consider a change. The three grades, primer, first, and second, have the largest enrollment and are in the same room under the same teacher. The year we had kindergarten work for the youngest ones was most satisfactory and I trust another year it will be possible for a budget allowance to provide again for this work. While the four upper grades have a nine months school term these others have only eight months. Henrietta. McCutchan and Mr. Overton coached the basketball teams and, as many of the pupils had never seen a game before coming here, it meant starting from the beginning. After getting into the new building light practice was made compulsory for all seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth grade boys and girls. The teams entered the East Tennessee high school tournament and although we were the only two year high school entrant our pupils made a very creditable show REPORTS OF OFFICERS ing. Another year both Mr. Over-ton and Miss McCutchan hope to do more along the line of supervised play. The usual plays and social affairs were given during the year and in whatever was done the cooperation was unusually good. We are sorry to have Miss Kibler leave this spring and very glad the other grade teachers will re-turn. All three special teachers are leaving this year, Mr. Mattil, Katherine Farmer, and Winogene Red-ding and the places will be hard to fill. Of the eight pupils completing second year high last year six have been in school this year, one in Newport High, one in Maryville High, three in Sevierville High, and one in Murphy Institute. The other two have been working this year to earn money to enter school next fall. Mrs. Duffield and Mrs. Gilbert, both former music teachers and now living in Gatlinburg, have given mu-sic lessons to quite a number of pupils but there has been no pul)lic school music taught in the school. This is always a regret as there is such a wonderful opportunity to develop this native talent. This year shows a still better reimbursement from the county for maintaining the eight grades of the day school, due to all teachers having state professional certificates. The county has paid us the past year for teachers and fuel $3,318. This does not include any of the state funds allowed us for agriculture, weaving, and home economics. The class work in agriculture, home economics, and weaving is incorporated into the reports of those departments. HoME EcoNomics The usual home economics cla; were held for first and second y high school girls; each class hav two periods every morning. W their work follows the state cot and has the same laboratory textbook work, girls here have m practical experience than usuall possible in a high school. ' classes are small and the home ( nomics girls are always willing take any extra piece of work, cc ing or sewing or cleaning, I comes up. In addition they h quite a little experience in corn tion with their dormitory Those who remain after scl closes to finish paying their be are beyond the practice stage are of real value. The evening school prograrr planned a year ago never did terialize. Instead of coming tc in January for full time ever school work, Jean Steele was to Elizabethton. Because of the dustrial situation there large n hers of mountain people had me into the town and presented a for work that only one with ex ence and ability could handle. state department felt that Jean the best one for the place. Katherine Watson devoted p tically all of her time to reg school work home economics science classes. They kept her f having time for evening sc work although she did manag get in one afternoon class each ti and the latter part of the year in one night class. Two intensive sewing c12 were held by Mrs. Zuccarellc the state department, and the di making done during those w was nothing short of ama; THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI ese courses were financed partly the state and partly by those ing the course. The exhibit at Gatlinburg Fair showed what week of sewing had accornshed. The home economics work closed the year at the end of the school m, no community classes being -ried on during the vacation. ks Katherine Watson married we a vacancy to fill at the end of school year. Miss Mary Rachel mstrong, University of Tenneswill take Katherine's place and, less present plans fail, will devote 7 entire time to home economics : cool classes in the morning and nmunity classes in the afternoon. already a full program is being rked out for the new year and we ill be glad to again take up these nmunity classes that we feel are very worth while. SGRICULTURE AND FARM SHOP [n writing a report of this departnt we have to remember that Mr. ittil has had so many different es of work outside of school rou e that we wonder he has been e to accomplish one-half that he n Smith Hughes agriculture !re is a school program that takes morning, each class having two -iods every day. This corre-)nds to the home economics pro-Lm. The afternoons should be en over to community work such junior poultry clubs, spraying pruning of orchards, advising stock and crops, veterinary ad e and treatment, and in fact do-; about everything called for. e shop work is along the line practical farm aid, making wag-beds and wheel barrows, self feeders for chickens and pigs, harness repairing, care of tools, etc. Each boy from the seventh grade up has a home project which he keeps an accurate record of, under the supervision of the teacher. These are varied. Some boys take a pig for a project, some a cow, others have crop projects. Many take poultry. The past two years the building program and other improvements have taken much of Mr. Mattil's time as he has supervised all these. It has been a real regret to him and to us that the educational work in nearby communities where he had had clubs and classes had to be dropped for this but no person could have handled both. In addition to these there is the farm to supervise and the student labor to keep in touch with. After seven years spent in organizing and building up this department Mr. Mattil feels he must give up teaching. We will have a hard task to fill his place, in fact shall not try to find anyone who can shoulder so much. He has done an outstanding piece of work which is recognized and appreciated by all. With the beginning of the new school year we shall go back to a distinct school program in this department, endeavoring to keep the outside things entirely separate from the work that rightfully be-longs to this department. For a year or more Mr. Mattil has been carrying on a very interesting piece of work independent of the school, yet somewhat associated with it too. The demands for antiques were so insistent he finally fitted up the old barn, near the school building, as a shop; putting an electric system and motors, REPORTS OF OFFICERS wood working machinery, etc., and employed from one to five boys to refinish old furniture and reproduce crickets, book shelves, tables, and in fact many different kinds of things which are sold in. the Arrow-craft Shop. The training these boys have had in the shop has been of the best and we only hope that Mr. Mattil has been able to at least come out even financially with the proposition. There is no doubt but that this has had a great influence on the furniture makers of the community for they are now bringing in better furniture than ever before. I am sure that eventually the school will want to take this over but at the present time we are only too glad to have Mr. Mattil want to keep it. FARM AND STUDENT LABOR The report of the farm and of the student labor is most satisfactory. More has been raised in the garden for the table, stock well cared for, fields in better condition, the place showing improvement generally. We are asked many times what we keep on the farm. We have three horses, one for farm work, two for the nurse and teachers. Four cows, one registered heifer gotten this past year, a registered Jersey bull, five Berkshire hogs, Barred Rock poultry, two Shropshire sheep gotten this year. About 100 hens are kept during the win-ter. At present we have nearly 1,000 little chicks, some to keep, most to be sold during the summer for ' fryers. Our incubators and brooders do service for the whole community. The farm and the student laboris all looked after by Otha Rea under the supervision and plann of Mr. Mattil. Otha is a ma: hand with the boys and as he been here a long time he is tl~ oughly familiar with Mr. Mat methods and can take a great of responsibility. Otha has b away because of illness for the five months and the work has b done by a former dormitory who has shown himself very c able. Having dormitory boys 1 year who had been here some t. has been a great help for all h shown themselves so very depe able and willing during this h siege. DORMITORIES Each year we are more fully c winced that the time and money u in supervising and providing a home life for our students who too far from the school to walk b and forth is well spent. The year we have had from six to boys and from eight to twelve g in the dormitories. Each stud has had regular hours of labor practically have had to look out all school expenses without any from home. Three boys had homes so their problems were larger ; how to earn enough fo new pair of overalls or shirt c hair cut in addition to all other penses. More than half of the mitory students finished their w here this spring so these places be filled this fall by new pupils. We have been most fortunat, having Mrs. Morgan in the g dormitory and to take care of meals for all this large family Iv] numbers now from thirty-five forty-five all the time.

Due to in family in the past few .e septic tank built ten years ago is inadequate and a new one must be put in this summer with new sewage lines. That will also be done by our men here. Mother made the move from the girls' to the boys' dormitory last fall and found the boys as nice to deal with as the girls. Discipline in either dormitory is not difficult but when one is willing and interested she can find plenty to do at either place and that kind of work requires being constantly with it. The past year two rooms in the teachers' cottage have been used by the boys, one for a dressing and wash room, one for a clubroom. The cottage in which they lived was too far for them to get to during the day. This summer we have rented the Jim Reagan cottage, which ad-joins our property and is near enough for all the needs of the boys. While the cottage is small the lo-cation so near the school will repay any other inconveniences they may have. The same schedule of work has been held to this year as last, the girls getting experience in practically every kind of work pertaining to homemaking, the boys in every-thing relating to stock and farm as well as general repair and up-keep work. LOCAL LABOR Not only the student labor but all the outside work has been done more satisfactorily the past year than ever before. Arlie Watson has taken care of furnaces and odd tasks during the winter, during the spring and summer has had a wonderful garden (which i used to supply our tables and also families who live in the Burg during the summer) and of course kept up many other duties. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 79 He and Otha Reagan make a fine team. Ernest Reagan continues to be with us and is the man for wiring, plumbing, repairing anything and everything. Two local girls who received some training in the evening class in home economics have done the cooking. Lillie Reagan continues as the nurse's assistant. We have eight local people on the pay roll and are proud of every one of them. WEAVING Again we can report continued growth in this department. While there have been the usual number of new products added to the Shop, things beautiful and decidedly sale-able, there has been a marked development in the real knowledge of the mechanics and art of weaving among the women. It has taken great effort to keep the weaving divided as equally and evenly among the people as possible and during the year forty-six women wove for the school, also four high school girls earned money in this way to continue school next year. Supervising weaving in fifty homes is a full-time task but the products show how well it is done. In addition to the individual instruction there have been six group meetings, with from sixteen to thirty women in attendance. These are possible since the new weaving room is finished. The new weaving, office, and storage rooms are almost too good to be true, and have relieved the stress" and strain in that department and other places too. Last spring the Smith Hughes vocational funds reimbursed us for the instruction given the afternoon class of women and with this money we employed Alice McCarter thisyear as assistant to Miss Redding. Alice is one of our local girls who has woven for us for years and is called the "loom doctor" because of being so expert in diagnosing and treating loom troubles of all kinds. I am glad to report that once again we have our regular classes in weaving for our school girls. The seventh and eighth grade girls have had two periods each day during the year, Alice and Miss Red-ding doing the teaching. Four new looms were gotten before school opened and three others rebuilt. With new weaving room and new looms, the results were most satisfactory. We are expecting reimbursement from the state again and hope that Alice will be able to continue her work another year. Weaving in the homes continues through every month of the year. Beginning with the first of January they start planning and working out new patterns and products for the next Christmas sales. There are still many more women who would like to weave but the present number is all that can be taken care of by the present weaving and Arrow-craft staffs. Both departments are working now to full capacity and it will be necessary after another year or two to discuss future development. The remarkable growth and development of the weaving department the past four years shows how efficient Winogene Redding has been and what a loss the school will sustain by her leaving. She has a thorough knowledge of her work and a most sympathetic understanding of the women with whom she has dealings and they have responded to all instruction and ad-vice remarkably well.

Mr. Mattil's shop, where finishing is done, has shown the local men such a marked difference between indifferently made furniture and that made from well seasoned wood, carefully put together and sanded and ready to be finished, that the men themselves have made marked progress in their work. The shop handles quite a good many finished articles as well as the unfinished stools and chairs. Although our main broom maker moved where he could "see the trucks pass all day and hear them of a night" other makers have been developed so we still.can supply the demand. The Gift Shop is not open on Sundays, to the dismay of a great many Pi Phis as well as other tourists, but we have felt we should take this stand. Last fall new price lists were printed and this spring an attractive cut has been made for all Arrow-craft products. The expense of the Arrowcraft Shop, the weaving department, part of the office expense, and extra help necessary during the rush season is met by the industrial department and we feel sure that all this considered there will be a profit again this year. But were we able to only come out even we would feel it all worth while. The $22,000 in cash paid all these weavers, basket, furniture and broom makers, quilters, hookers, and tufters means a real livelihood to one hundred families. Clubs and shop have been able to work together better than ever before each having a better under-standing of the needs of the other. No other school I know of has the splendid market we have and we surely value it most highly. All we REPORTS OF OFFICERS 81 have said concerning splendid club cooperation is sincere. ADMINISTRATION AND PUBLICITY Again, in this department as well as others, the same policies have been followed as in the year previous. The Gatlinburg News has been sent out each month to many local people, all officers of the fraternity, to each settlement chairman of the clubs, to those on the isolated alum-n lists, and to a good many individuals. With this has gone a let-ter from the school telling of the various departments and activities. These letters have also gone to the active chapters. An effort has been made to keep the letters short enough to be read easily and quickly at club and chapter meetings. With the increased business of the Arrowcraft there has been more and more to do in the office. A good many old accounts that have been on the books for years have been settled and the new accounts have been settled more promptly. The large business carried on and the tremendous amount of money necessarily advanced to maintain the department mean that we have had to have payments made more promptly than in former years. Clubs and individuals have responded splendily. Each year the student labor ac-counts are carried in a more business-like manner by both pupils and school and that again brings much added office work. The annual Mountain Workers Conference met in Knoxville the first week in April and a number of our staff attended some of the sessions at least. The conference isalways an inspiration and the contacts made with those from other schools is most helpful and pleasant. Following the conference we had the usual number of visitors to our school. In the fall I was in Berea four days, spending the entire time in observing work in various departments. Miss Cooke, Miss Allen, Miss Moore, and Mr. Mattil also visited Berea College. We received a great help in the line of publicity this year when Mr. and Mrs. Charles Rogers, of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, published and gave to the school for distribution, 10,000 copies of a leaflet telling of the history and activities of the school. This has met a long-felt need. COUNTY HEALTH UNIT Again I want to explain the way in which we cooperate with the county in the maintenance of a health unit. Instead of paying the nurse's salary directly to her it goes through the state health department, with appropriations from one other school in the county and from the county court. These funds are matched by state and federal funds, making a sufficient income for a county nurse, county health physician, and sanitary specialist these in addition to the nurses in the two schools. The state also furnishes free typhoid, smallpox, toxin-antitoxin serums, and other supplies. There is every promise of the best unit this year that we have ever had and the big objective for the year is sanitating the entire county. For this big task the state is furnishing additional assistance to the present staff.

The )f seeing that every home, , and church has a sanitary is a sufficient piece of work to keep two men busy for months to come. Yet sanitation is the thing needed and I believe that a reason-able amount of cooperation will come from the people. The additional appropriation from the county court is providing men for this extra work. Our nurse now has a car, the state paying the upkeep of it. While a car will not take the place of a horse it many times saves a great deal of time and hard riding and with so many better roads seems a necessity. It also is a great convenience in taking patients to Knoxville for examination and treatment as the school truck is not always available nor very comfortable for trips of that kind. Six first year high school girls took the course in home nursing and care of the sick and received state certificates. During the summer Frances has organized two Little Mothers classes. These meet two afternoons each week and undoubtedly are the cutest things you ever saw. She gives the children instruction in how to care for their baby brothers and sisters and it is a course that some of the older ones might be proud to take. Two high school girls who had taken the home hygiene and care of the sick course assisted at the last tonsil clinic and demonstrated that their study had not been spent in vain. Two children were taken to the Trachoma Hospital for treatment and several others were given examinations. A Knoxville specialist gave two days for examining eyes and fitting glasses, saving us many hard trips to Knoxville with children. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 83 COMMUNITY It often seems that we do very little in real community work, yet we probably touch the people much more than we realize. Our crying need these days is a real social worker, one who can give Saturdays and Sundays to the young people who spend their time in the Burg with nothing to do. Library and reading room should be kept open. Books and magazines are here but no one with time enough to devote to keeping playrooms and reading rooms open. During the winter the auditorium was used by the community basket-ball team, Mr. Overton giving much of his time to their practice and games. There have been movies two nights each week since the first of May and they will continue through the summer. This year Arlie Watson and Ernest Reagan are the managers. It is difficult to always get the kind of films we want but on the whole the pictures are fairly good. Old Timers Day is one of the great events of the year, bringing many families in for a real get-together day. The Gatlinburg Fair continues to be the big day of the year. Between 500 and 600 school pupils from Gatlinburg and nearby communities join in the school parade and take part in athletic events during the day. The exhibits are of a high grade and truly "a good time is had by all." We believe it would be worth while to hold it two days in-stead of one. Our Christmas entertainment and tree, the plays during the school year always bring a house full of attentive people. It is our plan tohave more in the line of entertainment and educational addresses now that we have an auditorium. The university and state departments are always more than willing to be of help. Several teachers have had Sunday School classes and usually some at-tend the preaching services which now come twice a month instead of only once. The country church never does develop as fast as school and business do, unfortunately, yet there is a wonderful field waiting for someone to work in. Even though good roads and cars make it very easy for us and for the people here to take their recreation elsewhere we all feel that there is a great need for the home and community social life. EMMA HARPER TURNER CENTER SUGARLANDS The extension school and community work at Sugarlands continues to be one of our most interesting pieces of work. Emily Burton joined the Sugar-lands staff, after ten years in the Gatlinburg school. Eva Hathaway returned for her second year there. Mrs. Dowell left the Burg and be-came housemother and community worker in Sugarlands. These made a fine team. The two girls had the school work, and of course much community work too. Mrs. Dowell took care of the home, taught cooking and sewing, and helped with different outside things. In the winter Mrs. Dowell spent a week at the University of Tennessee for the farm women's short course and came back with plenty of ideas to work out with the local women. One was the making of rugs, hooked and braided.

You have your own home life with a small family, you come close to the people around you and it seems as though you can see more being accomplished from day to day than in a larger center. Perhaps we in Gatlinburg sometimes are a little envious. PERMANENT IMPROVEMENTS AND REPAIRS 1928-29 Stuart Cottage : reroof, laundry improved and heated, new water heater and tank installed, coal storage made.

The building and improvement program of the past two years has been a heavy one but it is pra.eti.. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 85 cally accomplished. It will take careful planning for another two years to get it all paid for and into anything like an easy financial condition but it will come and in the meantime we know that there will be the best possible response from clubs and chapters and we in turn will be as careful as possible of the expenditures here. Our school has never had many large gifts from individuals and even a building pro-gram is carried on largely from the regular donations of the year which make up the budget. No extra drives for funds have been made and it is a real accomplishment to have the new building as nearly paid for as it is under these circumstances. During the winter the treasury was in a most pitiful condition and it was necessary to give a cry of distress. It surely was answered and month by month funds have come in to keep us going but it continues to be a hard struggle for the treasurer. All are glad that this year is behind us and we can start on a new one. .A big task brings a challenge that no doubt is good for us all. Again I want to express my appreciation of the help that has come from officers, clubs, and chapters and for the splendid cooperation of each one on the staff. Each letter, each visit, and each check has helped more than you can realize. Respectfully submitted, EvELYN BISHOP ARROWCRAFT REPORT So much attention has been given in the past few years to the finding for and marketing of the Arrow-craft products that very little atten-tion has been given to those who make the products especially the furniture and basket makers. This past year things have been so organized that we have known bet-ter what we wanted the people to make. The clubs are becoming more familiar with the products and know better what they can and can-not sell. Their orders have come in earlier and they have been free in saying what they felt were best sellers. With every order there has been much correspondence which we feel sure has resulted in better understanding between the clubs and the shop and has been of in-valuable help in timely final settlements. By appealing to the people's pride we have been able to bring up the standards of the baskets. They are beginning to realize they are only hurting themselves when they make a poor basket. When.two or three arrive at the same time you can always hear them criticising one another's baskets bragging on the good points at times but more often pointing out the bad ones. In this way I feel they have helped one another more than we could ever have, regardless of how much we might have talked and scolded. I believe that Mr. Mattil's shop has done more to bring up the standard of the furniture than any-thing ever has or ever could have done. For over two years I talked seasoned wood, sand paper, and, a lot of care in making but I didn't get very far. After Mr. Mattil started his shop I had some things finished to use as samples. The furniture makers seemed amazed to think the things they made "just old common settin' chairs" could be made to look so pretty. One comment THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI : "I 'low that's pretty enough t in anybody's house." It Lied that they always had the that furniture was just rough f that didn't matter much and re wasn't any need in spending t of time on it. One of the best :ers seemed very interested in ing out how it was done, spend-an entire morning asking ques-.s. My curiosity was aroused so ;ked him what he was planning .o. Then he told me he was maksome black walnut chairs for [self and was going to finish n. I felt then that something really been accomplished. Just long we will be able to get the kets and chairs no one knows as 1y of the people have sold out the Park and of course that ins they can no longer cut the )d. here is just one woman and her ghter that do the tufting on the [I mats and bed spreads. She ught her first things to the Shop rly two years ago and they were ful attempts. She appealed to s's sympathy and by encouraging [ suggestions as to colors, etc., we re been able to help her until now one could ask for lovelier things n those she brings in. Ve have had our first quilts this r and have been very fortunate vetting them. Instead of starting h an inexperienced person we re begun with a master quilter. s. Hatcher and her mother-in-., from Wears Valley, do the Ming and I have never seen love-. We have only the full bed size its but hope to eventually work aby crib covers, comforts, etc. hrough Mrs. Dowell's effort we .e had a few hooked mats from Sugarlands. However, we hope to concentrate on braided rugs there and leave the hooking to the women who have been doing it for so long. We have never had any braided rugs but feel there is a market for them. The buying requires more time than it once did, for in these busy days we do not have the opportunity for home visiting and our greatest contact comes through the Shop visiting. This year we have had two exhibits at fairs one at the East Tennessee Division State Fair and one at the Tri-State Fair at Memphis. It was the first exhibit we had had at Knoxville of our industrial products. The fair association there, was not allowed to pay the expenses of the exhibit but did give us a premium of $75 which took care of all expenses. The alumnae club of Memphis had charge of the exhibit there (which was the fourth we have had) and bore all expenses. At both places a loom was used to demonstrate. At last we have a tag to mark all Arrowcraft products and one which everyone will like. I feel sure the clubs will welcome these. The price list was revised in the summer and this, with a letter of explanation and a club, or wholesale price list, was sent to each club in the fall. The circulars given to us by Mr. Rogers, of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, have been a world of help as hardly any-one comes into the Shop that doesn't want something that tells about the school. While the gross amount shipped isn't so much greater this year than last there has been less returned for credit. This is a result of smaller orders to more clubs. To date the gross sales have been REPORTS OF OFFICERS 87 $26,201.55 returned for credit $5,981.18. Net business $20,220.37. To ninety-eight people bringing things to the Shop we have paid $22,374.53, an average of $228.31 to each person. Taking the fifty weavers out and the $6,711.59 paid them, it leaves forty-eight basket makers, broom tyers, furniture makers, hookers, tufters and quilters receiving a total of $15,662.94. Everything recommended last year has been carried out with the exception of the water and toilet facilities in the Shop. With so many other improvements being made there never seemed to be a time when the necessary labor was available. We expect to get this done during the summer. There is only one recommendation I feel should be made this year. That is for a Shop in the new Mountain View Hotel which is to be erected this coming winter. I have talked to Mr. Huff about it and he says there is a space in the hotel for such a shop as we would want and that as long as the school is here and wants the space no one else shall have it. I feel sure the space can be leased for a nominal sum. We know that we are not getting our share of the tourist trade and this shop may be a possible solution. There are pros and cons that will need to be carefully discussed at committee meeting. Respectfully submitted, LADELLE ALLEN WEAVING REPORT Another year has come and gone and it is time once more for an annual report. This year I feel as if somethingdefinite has been accomplished among the women of the community. It is hard to put into words, as it is more a feeling of satisfaction that the educational goal that I have been striving toward for four years is in sight at last, than it is a condition that can be seen or expressed in so many sentences. It may be due in part to knowing the women more thoroughly, realizing the shortcomings of each woman and so knowing just how to handle the individual cases in order to give everyone the weaving help best suited to make her happy and satisfied. This only comes from long acquaintance and congenial workers. Working conditions are ideal now and have helped wonderfully to make the work run smoothly. The office, supply room, and large weaving room are in constant use. Sup-plies can be kept in better condition and more easily handled, saving much time. The office makes a convenient and necessary place for the women to bring in their weaving, and get material and receive directions for their weekly weaving. The class room is used the year around: for classes during the school year; several women use the warping bars and it gives a place where the women of the en-tire community can gather for group instruction, a most necessary part of the work, and until this year not available because of lack of space. I have found that the women respond enthusiastically to group instruction and the few meetings we have been able to hold have made the women much more independent in a technical way. They are gradually becoming more expert in the mechanics of weaving due to the rigid campaign held throughout THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI ar for looms in perfect work--Eder and the emphasis put on trly stages of warping, beamnd threading.

This [ am giving the weaving only. From June 1, 1928, to May 17, 1929, we have bought from the women $6,711.59 worth of weaving. More women have their own warping bars so only fifty-nine warps have been made on the school bars. Between September 18, 1928, and December 15, 1928, and February 11, 1929, and May 17, 1929, there have been 621 calls on weaving business only and I have made 117 calls in the homes. The school class was successful. Alice McCarter taught the class practical weaving and I gave the notebook work. There were seven in the class, seventh and eighth grade girls. They paid for the materials they used by weaving towels and selling them to the school. Alice helped me in many other ways and proved to be a valuable assistant. I have tried to spread out the weaving among more families by limiting each home to one loom and keeping the weaving in Gatlinburg and vicinity. There are four young girls weaving this summer to earn money to go to high school next fall, making a total of fifty weavers this year. From my experience I believe that to supervise fifty women and to visit fifty homes located in various degrees of distance and accessibility is all that one person can do successfully. The work seems to be at a good place to pass on to someone else. There have been the usual amount of trials and tribulations, jealousy among the weavers, etc., but I have enjoyed my work here to the utmost and I regret that I have to give it up.

SCHOOL n spite of the confusion caused the unfinished building and so ch sickness, we feel we can re-'t a more than usually successful :he total enrollment was 168--:nty-six of that number were in t and second year high school. Vlr. Overton had accomplished much the year previous in seing certificates, rating, etc., for school that the new year started much easier. Every teacher had state certificate at the opening school and there were no doubts )ut the rating with the state de--tment. dr. Overton and Miss Kibler had same classes as the year before, Overton taking all the mathetics for the seventh, eighth, ,th, and tenth grades and Miss )ler all the English. In the fall se classes were held in the new lding but as mornings grew cool y would be one day in the old 1 the next in the new. Finally it s necessary to go back into the quarters and stay there until heating system was completed January. Light pupils completed second Lr high school and all expect to enter some other school in the fall. While only three received eighth grade certificates the first year high school class will probably have the usual number as nearly all those pupils come from nearby schools but far enough away to make it necessary for them to be in the dormitory. Eleanor Brabson, Alice Williams, and Henrietta McCutchan made a splendid team and although they were here for the first time they found no difficulty in quickly adjusting themselves to their new work as they were three very efficient teachers. Alice had the fifth and sixth grades, Henrietta the third and fourth, and Eleanor the primary, first, and second. There is a real criticism that could be made and I hope before long we can consider a change. The three grades, primer, first, and second, have the largest enrollment and are in the same room under the same teacher. The year we had kindergarten work for the youngest ones was most satisfactory and I trust another year it will be possible for a budget allowance to provide again for this work. While the four upper grades have a nine months school term these others have only eight months. Henrietta. McCutchan and Mr. Overton coached the basketball teams and, as many of the pupils had never seen a game before coming here, it meant starting from the beginning. After getting into the new building light practice was made compulsory for all seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth grade boys and girls. The teams entered the East Tennessee high school tournament and although we were the only two year high school entrant our pupils made a very creditable show REPORTS OF OFFICERS ing. Another year both Mr. Over-ton and Miss McCutchan hope to do more along the line of supervised play. The usual plays and social affairs were given during the year and in whatever was done the cooperation was unusually good. We are sorry to have Miss Kibler leave this spring and very glad the other grade teachers will re-turn. All three special teachers are leaving this year, Mr. Mattil, Katherine Farmer, and Winogene Red-ding and the places will be hard to fill. Of the eight pupils completing second year high last year six have been in school this year, one in Newport High, one in Maryville High, three in Sevierville High, and one in Murphy Institute. The other two have been working this year to earn money to enter school next fall. Mrs. Duffield and Mrs. Gilbert, both former music teachers and now living in Gatlinburg, have given mu-sic lessons to quite a number of pupils but there has been no pul)lic school music taught in the school. This is always a regret as there is such a wonderful opportunity to develop this native talent. This year shows a still better reimbursement from the county for maintaining the eight grades of the day school, due to all teachers having state professional certificates. The county has paid us the past year for teachers and fuel $3,318. This does not include any of the state funds allowed us for agriculture, weaving, and home economics. The class work in agriculture, home economics, and weaving is incorporated into the reports of those departments. HoME EcoNomics The usual home economics cla; were held for first and second y high school girls; each class hav two periods every morning. W their work follows the state cot and has the same laboratory textbook work, girls here have m practical experience than usuall possible in a high school. ' classes are small and the home ( nomics girls are always willing take any extra piece of work, cc ing or sewing or cleaning, I comes up. In addition they h quite a little experience in corn tion with their dormitory Those who remain after scl closes to finish paying their be are beyond the practice stage are of real value. The evening school prograrr planned a year ago never did terialize. Instead of coming tc in January for full time ever school work, Jean Steele was to Elizabethton. Because of the dustrial situation there large n hers of mountain people had me into the town and presented a for work that only one with ex ence and ability could handle. state department felt that Jean the best one for the place. Katherine Watson devoted p tically all of her time to reg school work home economics science classes. They kept her f having time for evening sc work although she did manag get in one afternoon class each ti and the latter part of the year in one night class. Two intensive sewing c12 were held by Mrs. Zuccarellc the state department, and the di making done during those w was nothing short of ama; THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI ese courses were financed partly the state and partly by those ing the course. The exhibit at Gatlinburg Fair showed what week of sewing had accornshed. The home economics work closed the year at the end of the school m, no community classes being -ried on during the vacation. ks Katherine Watson married we a vacancy to fill at the end of school year. Miss Mary Rachel mstrong, University of Tenneswill take Katherine's place and, less present plans fail, will devote 7 entire time to home economics : cool classes in the morning and nmunity classes in the afternoon. already a full program is being rked out for the new year and we ill be glad to again take up these nmunity classes that we feel are very worth while. SGRICULTURE AND FARM SHOP [n writing a report of this departnt we have to remember that Mr. ittil has had so many different es of work outside of school rou e that we wonder he has been e to accomplish one-half that he n Smith Hughes agriculture !re is a school program that takes morning, each class having two -iods every day. This corre-)nds to the home economics pro-Lm. The afternoons should be en over to community work such junior poultry clubs, spraying pruning of orchards, advising stock and crops, veterinary ad e and treatment, and in fact do-; about everything called for. e shop work is along the line practical farm aid, making wag-beds and wheel barrows, self feeders for chickens and pigs, harness repairing, care of tools, etc. Each boy from the seventh grade up has a home project which he keeps an accurate record of, under the supervision of the teacher. These are varied. Some boys take a pig for a project, some a cow, others have crop projects. Many take poultry. The past two years the building program and other improvements have taken much of Mr. Mattil's time as he has supervised all these. It has been a real regret to him and to us that the educational work in nearby communities where he had had clubs and classes had to be dropped for this but no person could have handled both. In addition to these there is the farm to supervise and the student labor to keep in touch with. After seven years spent in organizing and building up this department Mr. Mattil feels he must give up teaching. We will have a hard task to fill his place, in fact shall not try to find anyone who can shoulder so much. He has done an outstanding piece of work which is recognized and appreciated by all. With the beginning of the new school year we shall go back to a distinct school program in this department, endeavoring to keep the outside things entirely separate from the work that rightfully be-longs to this department. For a year or more Mr. Mattil has been carrying on a very interesting piece of work independent of the school, yet somewhat associated with it too. The demands for antiques were so insistent he finally fitted up the old barn, near the school building, as a shop; putting an electric system and motors, REPORTS OF OFFICERS wood working machinery, etc., and employed from one to five boys to refinish old furniture and reproduce crickets, book shelves, tables, and in fact many different kinds of things which are sold in. the Arrow-craft Shop. The training these boys have had in the shop has been of the best and we only hope that Mr. Mattil has been able to at least come out even financially with the proposition. There is no doubt but that this has had a great influence on the furniture makers of the community for they are now bringing in better furniture than ever before. I am sure that eventually the school will want to take this over but at the present time we are only too glad to have Mr. Mattil want to keep it. FARM AND STUDENT LABOR The report of the farm and of the student labor is most satisfactory. More has been raised in the garden for the table, stock well cared for, fields in better condition, the place showing improvement generally. We are asked many times what we keep on the farm. We have three horses, one for farm work, two for the nurse and teachers. Four cows, one registered heifer gotten this past year, a registered Jersey bull, five Berkshire hogs, Barred Rock poultry, two Shropshire sheep gotten this year. About 100 hens are kept during the win-ter. At present we have nearly 1,000 little chicks, some to keep, most to be sold during the summer for ' fryers. Our incubators and brooders do service for the whole community. The farm and the student laboris all looked after by Otha Rea under the supervision and plann of Mr. Mattil. Otha is a ma: hand with the boys and as he been here a long time he is tl~ oughly familiar with Mr. Mat methods and can take a great of responsibility. Otha has b away because of illness for the five months and the work has b done by a former dormitory who has shown himself very c able. Having dormitory boys 1 year who had been here some t. has been a great help for all h shown themselves so very depe able and willing during this h siege. DORMITORIES Each year we are more fully c winced that the time and money u in supervising and providing a home life for our students who too far from the school to walk b and forth is well spent. The year we have had from six to boys and from eight to twelve g in the dormitories. Each stud has had regular hours of labor practically have had to look out all school expenses without any from home. Three boys had homes so their problems were larger ; how to earn enough fo new pair of overalls or shirt c hair cut in addition to all other penses. More than half of the mitory students finished their w here this spring so these places be filled this fall by new pupils.

Due to in family in the past few .e septic tank built ten years ago is inadequate and a new one must be put in this summer with new sewage lines. That will also be done by our men here. Mother made the move from the girls' to the boys' dormitory last fall and found the boys as nice to deal with as the girls. Discipline in either dormitory is not difficult but when one is willing and interested she can find plenty to do at either place and that kind of work requires being constantly with it. The past year two rooms in the teachers' cottage have been used by the boys, one for a dressing and wash room, one for a clubroom. The cottage in which they lived was too far for them to get to during the day. This summer we have rented the Jim Reagan cottage, which ad-joins our property and is near enough for all the needs of the boys. While the cottage is small the lo-cation so near the school will repay any other inconveniences they may have. The same schedule of work has been held to this year as last, the girls getting experience in practically every kind of work pertaining to homemaking, the boys in every-thing relating to stock and farm as well as general repair and up-keep work. LOCAL LABOR Not only the student labor but all the outside work has been done more satisfactorily the past year than ever before. Arlie Watson has taken care of furnaces and odd tasks during the winter, during the spring and summer has had a wonderful garden (which i used to supply our tables and also families who live in the Burg during the summer) and of course kept up many other duties. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 79 He and Otha Reagan make a fine team. Ernest Reagan continues to be with us and is the man for wiring, plumbing, repairing anything and everything. Two local girls who received some training in the evening class in home economics have done the cooking. Lillie Reagan continues as the nurse's assistant. We have eight local people on the pay roll and are proud of every one of them. WEAVING Again we can report continued growth in this department. While there have been the usual number of new products added to the Shop, things beautiful and decidedly sale-able, there has been a marked development in the real knowledge of the mechanics and art of weaving among the women. It has taken great effort to keep the weaving divided as equally and evenly among the people as possible and during the year forty-six women wove for the school, also four high school girls earned money in this way to continue school next year. Supervising weaving in fifty homes is a full-time task but the products show how well it is done. In addition to the individual instruction there have been six group meetings, with from sixteen to thirty women in attendance. These are possible since the new weaving room is finished. The new weaving, office, and storage rooms are almost too good to be true, and have relieved the stress" and strain in that department and other places too. Last spring the Smith Hughes vocational funds reimbursed us for the instruction given the afternoon class of women and with this money we employed Alice McCarter thisyear as assistant to Miss Redding. Alice is one of our local girls who has woven for us for years and is called the "loom doctor" because of being so expert in diagnosing and treating loom troubles of all kinds. I am glad to report that once again we have our regular classes in weaving for our school girls. The seventh and eighth grade girls have had two periods each day during the year, Alice and Miss Red-ding doing the teaching. Four new looms were gotten before school opened and three others rebuilt. With new weaving room and new looms, the results were most satisfactory. We are expecting reimbursement from the state again and hope that Alice will be able to continue her work another year. Weaving in the homes continues through every month of the year. Beginning with the first of January they start planning and working out new patterns and products for the next Christmas sales. There are still many more women who would like to weave but the present number is all that can be taken care of by the present weaving and Arrow-craft staffs. Both departments are working now to full capacity and it will be necessary after another year or two to discuss future development. The remarkable growth and development of the weaving department the past four years shows how efficient Winogene Redding has been and what a loss the school will sustain by her leaving. She has a thorough knowledge of her work and a most sympathetic understanding of the women with whom she has dealings and they have responded to all instruction and ad-vice remarkably well.

Mr. Mattil's shop, where finishing is done, has shown the local men such a marked difference between indifferently made furniture and that made from well seasoned wood, carefully put together and sanded and ready to be finished, that the men themselves have made marked progress in their work. The shop handles quite a good many finished articles as well as the unfinished stools and chairs. Although our main broom maker moved where he could "see the trucks pass all day and hear them of a night" other makers have been developed so we still.can supply the demand. The Gift Shop is not open on Sundays, to the dismay of a great many Pi Phis as well as other tourists, but we have felt we should take this stand. Last fall new price lists were printed and this spring an attractive cut has been made for all Arrow-craft products. The expense of the Arrowcraft Shop, the weaving department, part of the office expense, and extra help necessary during the rush season is met by the industrial department and we feel sure that all this considered there will be a profit again this year. But were we able to only come out even we would feel it all worth while. The $22,000 in cash paid all these weavers, basket, furniture and broom makers, quilters, hookers, and tufters means a real livelihood to one hundred families. Clubs and shop have been able to work together better than ever before each having a better under-standing of the needs of the other. No other school I know of has the splendid market we have and we surely value it most highly. All we REPORTS OF OFFICERS 81 have said concerning splendid club cooperation is sincere. ADMINISTRATION AND PUBLICITY Again, in this department as well as others, the same policies have been followed as in the year previous. The Gatlinburg News has been sent out each month to many local people, all officers of the fraternity, to each settlement chairman of the clubs, to those on the isolated alum-n lists, and to a good many individuals. With this has gone a let-ter from the school telling of the various departments and activities. These letters have also gone to the active chapters. An effort has been made to keep the letters short enough to be read easily and quickly at club and chapter meetings. With the increased business of the Arrowcraft there has been more and more to do in the office. A good many old accounts that have been on the books for years have been settled and the new accounts have been settled more promptly. The large business carried on and the tremendous amount of money necessarily advanced to maintain the department mean that we have had to have payments made more promptly than in former years. Clubs and individuals have responded splendily. Each year the student labor ac-counts are carried in a more business-like manner by both pupils and school and that again brings much added office work. The annual Mountain Workers Conference met in Knoxville the first week in April and a number of our staff attended some of the sessions at least. The conference isalways an inspiration and the contacts made with those from other schools is most helpful and pleasant. Following the conference we had the usual number of visitors to our school. In the fall I was in Berea four days, spending the entire time in observing work in various departments. Miss Cooke, Miss Allen, Miss Moore, and Mr. Mattil also visited Berea College. We received a great help in the line of publicity this year when Mr. and Mrs. Charles Rogers, of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, published and gave to the school for distribution, 10,000 copies of a leaflet telling of the history and activities of the school. This has met a long-felt need. COUNTY HEALTH UNIT Again I want to explain the way in which we cooperate with the county in the maintenance of a health unit. Instead of paying the nurse's salary directly to her it goes through the state health department, with appropriations from one other school in the county and from the county court. These funds are matched by state and federal funds, making a sufficient income for a county nurse, county health physician, and sanitary specialist these in addition to the nurses in the two schools. The state also furnishes free typhoid, smallpox, toxin-antitoxin serums, and other supplies. There is every promise of the best unit this year that we have ever had and the big objective for the year is sanitating the entire county. For this big task the state is furnishing additional assistance to the present staff.

The )f seeing that every home, , and church has a sanitary is a sufficient piece of work to keep two men busy for months to come. Yet sanitation is the thing needed and I believe that a reason-able amount of cooperation will come from the people. The additional appropriation from the county court is providing men for this extra work. Our nurse now has a car, the state paying the upkeep of it. While a car will not take the place of a horse it many times saves a great deal of time and hard riding and with so many better roads seems a necessity. It also is a great convenience in taking patients to Knoxville for examination and treatment as the school truck is not always available nor very comfortable for trips of that kind. Six first year high school girls took the course in home nursing and care of the sick and received state certificates. During the summer Frances has organized two Little Mothers classes. These meet two afternoons each week and undoubtedly are the cutest things you ever saw. She gives the children instruction in how to care for their baby brothers and sisters and it is a course that some of the older ones might be proud to take. Two high school girls who had taken the home hygiene and care of the sick course assisted at the last tonsil clinic and demonstrated that their study had not been spent in vain. Two children were taken to the Trachoma Hospital for treatment and several others were given examinations. A Knoxville specialist gave two days for examining eyes and fitting glasses, saving us many hard trips to Knoxville with children. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 83 COMMUNITY It often seems that we do very little in real community work, yet we probably touch the people much more than we realize. Our crying need these days is a real social worker, one who can give Saturdays and Sundays to the young people who spend their time in the Burg with nothing to do. Library and reading room should be kept open. Books and magazines are here but no one with time enough to devote to keeping playrooms and reading rooms open. During the winter the auditorium was used by the community basket-ball team, Mr. Overton giving much of his time to their practice and games. There have been movies two nights each week since the first of May and they will continue through the summer. This year Arlie Watson and Ernest Reagan are the managers. It is difficult to always get the kind of films we want but on the whole the pictures are fairly good. Old Timers Day is one of the great events of the year, bringing many families in for a real get-together day. The Gatlinburg Fair continues to be the big day of the year. Between 500 and 600 school pupils from Gatlinburg and nearby communities join in the school parade and take part in athletic events during the day. The exhibits are of a high grade and truly "a good time is had by all." We believe it would be worth while to hold it two days in-stead of one. Our Christmas entertainment and tree, the plays during the school year always bring a house full of attentive people. It is our plan tohave more in the line of entertainment and educational addresses now that we have an auditorium. The university and state departments are always more than willing to be of help. Several teachers have had Sunday School classes and usually some at-tend the preaching services which now come twice a month instead of only once. The country church never does develop as fast as school and business do, unfortunately, yet there is a wonderful field waiting for someone to work in. Even though good roads and cars make it very easy for us and for the people here to take their recreation elsewhere we all feel that there is a great need for the home and community social life. EMMA HARPER TURNER CENTER SUGARLANDS The extension school and community work at Sugarlands continues to be one of our most interesting pieces of work. Emily Burton joined the Sugar-lands staff, after ten years in the Gatlinburg school. Eva Hathaway returned for her second year there. Mrs. Dowell left the Burg and be-came housemother and community worker in Sugarlands. These made a fine team. The two girls had the school work, and of course much community work too. Mrs. Dowell took care of the home, taught cooking and sewing, and helped with different outside things. In the winter Mrs. Dowell spent a week at the University of Tennessee for the farm women's short course and came back with plenty of ideas to work out with the local women. One was the making of rugs, hooked and braided.

You have your own home life with a small family, you come close to the people around you and it seems as though you can see more being accomplished from day to day than in a larger center. Perhaps we in Gatlinburg sometimes are a little envious. PERMANENT IMPROVEMENTS AND REPAIRS 1928-29 Stuart Cottage : reroof, laundry improved and heated, new water heater and tank installed, coal storage made.

It will take careful planning for another two years to get it all paid for and into anything like an easy financial condition but it will come and in the meantime we know that there will be the best possible response from clubs and chapters and we in turn will be as careful as possible of the expenditures here. Our school has never had many large gifts from individuals and even a building pro-gram is carried on largely from the regular donations of the year which make up the budget. No extra drives for funds have been made and it is a real accomplishment to have the new building as nearly paid for as it is under these circumstances. During the winter the treasury was in a most pitiful condition and it was necessary to give a cry of distress. It surely was answered and month by month funds have come in to keep us going but it continues to be a hard struggle for the treasurer. All are glad that this year is behind us and we can start on a new one. .A big task brings a challenge that no doubt is good for us all. Again I want to express my appreciation of the help that has come from officers, clubs, and chapters and for the splendid cooperation of each one on the staff. Each letter, each visit, and each check has helped more than you can realize. Respectfully submitted, EvELYN BISHOP ARROWCRAFT REPORT So much attention has been given in the past few years to the finding for and marketing of the Arrow-craft products that very little atten-tion has been given to those who make the products especially the furniture and basket makers. This past year things have been so organized that we have known bet-ter what we wanted the people to make. The clubs are becoming more familiar with the products and know better what they can and can-not sell. Their orders have come in earlier and they have been free in saying what they felt were best sellers. With every order there has been much correspondence which we feel sure has resulted in better understanding between the clubs and the shop and has been of in-valuable help in timely final settlements. By appealing to the people's pride we have been able to bring up the standards of the baskets. They are beginning to realize they are only hurting themselves when they make a poor basket. When.two or three arrive at the same time you can always hear them criticising one another's baskets bragging on the good points at times but more often pointing out the bad ones. In this way I feel they have helped one another more than we could ever have, regardless of how much we might have talked and scolded. I believe that Mr. Mattil's shop has done more to bring up the standard of the furniture than any-thing ever has or ever could have done. For over two years I talked seasoned wood, sand paper, and, a lot of care in making but I didn't get very far. After Mr. Mattil started his shop I had some things finished to use as samples. The furniture makers seemed amazed to think the things they made "just old common settin' chairs" could be made to look so pretty. One comment THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI : "I 'low that's pretty enough t in anybody's house." It Lied that they always had the that furniture was just rough f that didn't matter much and re wasn't any need in spending t of time on it. One of the best :ers seemed very interested in ing out how it was done, spend-an entire morning asking ques-.s. My curiosity was aroused so ;ked him what he was planning .o. Then he told me he was maksome black walnut chairs for [self and was going to finish n. I felt then that something really been accomplished. Just long we will be able to get the kets and chairs no one knows as 1y of the people have sold out the Park and of course that ins they can no longer cut the )d. here is just one woman and her ghter that do the tufting on the [I mats and bed spreads. She ught her first things to the Shop rly two years ago and they were ful attempts. She appealed to s's sympathy and by encouraging [ suggestions as to colors, etc., we re been able to help her until now one could ask for lovelier things n those she brings in. Ve have had our first quilts this r and have been very fortunate vetting them. Instead of starting h an inexperienced person we re begun with a master quilter. s. Hatcher and her mother-in-., from Wears Valley, do the Ming and I have never seen love-. We have only the full bed size its but hope to eventually work aby crib covers, comforts, etc. hrough Mrs. Dowell's effort we .e had a few hooked mats from Sugarlands. However, we hope to concentrate on braided rugs there and leave the hooking to the women who have been doing it for so long. We have never had any braided rugs but feel there is a market for them. The buying requires more time than it once did, for in these busy days we do not have the opportunity for home visiting and our greatest contact comes through the Shop visiting. This year we have had two exhibits at fairs one at the East Tennessee Division State Fair and one at the Tri-State Fair at Memphis. It was the first exhibit we had had at Knoxville of our industrial products. The fair association there, was not allowed to pay the expenses of the exhibit but did give us a premium of $75 which took care of all expenses. The alumnae club of Memphis had charge of the exhibit there (which was the fourth we have had) and bore all expenses. At both places a loom was used to demonstrate. At last we have a tag to mark all Arrowcraft products and one which everyone will like. I feel sure the clubs will welcome these. The price list was revised in the summer and this, with a letter of explanation and a club, or wholesale price list, was sent to each club in the fall. The circulars given to us by Mr. Rogers, of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, have been a world of help as hardly any-one comes into the Shop that doesn't want something that tells about the school. While the gross amount shipped isn't so much greater this year than last there has been less returned for credit. This is a result of smaller orders to more clubs. To date the gross sales have been REPORTS OF OFFICERS 87 $26,201.55 returned for credit $5,981.18. Net business $20,220.37. To ninety-eight people bringing things to the Shop we have paid $22,374.53, an average of $228.31 to each person. Taking the fifty weavers out and the $6,711.59 paid them, it leaves forty-eight basket makers, broom tyers, furniture makers, hookers, tufters and quilters receiving a total of $15,662.94. Everything recommended last year has been carried out with the exception of the water and toilet facilities in the Shop. With so many other improvements being made there never seemed to be a time when the necessary labor was available. We expect to get this done during the summer. There is only one recommendation I feel should be made this year. That is for a Shop in the new Mountain View Hotel which is to be erected this coming winter. I have talked to Mr. Huff about it and he says there is a space in the hotel for such a shop as we would want and that as long as the school is here and wants the space no one else shall have it. I feel sure the space can be leased for a nominal sum. We know that we are not getting our share of the tourist trade and this shop may be a possible solution. There are pros and cons that will need to be carefully discussed at committee meeting. Respectfully submitted, LADELLE ALLEN WEAVING REPORT Another year has come and gone and it is time once more for an annual report. This year I feel as if somethingdefinite has been accomplished among the women of the community. It is hard to put into words, as it is more a feeling of satisfaction that the educational goal that I have been striving toward for four years is in sight at last, than it is a condition that can be seen or expressed in so many sentences. It may be due in part to knowing the women more thoroughly, realizing the shortcomings of each woman and so knowing just how to handle the individual cases in order to give everyone the weaving help best suited to make her happy and satisfied. This only comes from long acquaintance and congenial workers. Working conditions are ideal now and have helped wonderfully to make the work run smoothly. The office, supply room, and large weaving room are in constant use. Sup-plies can be kept in better condition and more easily handled, saving much time. The office makes a convenient and necessary place for the women to bring in their weaving, and get material and receive directions for their weekly weaving. The class room is used the year around: for classes during the school year; several women use the warping bars and it gives a place where the women of the en-tire community can gather for group instruction, a most necessary part of the work, and until this year not available because of lack of space. I have found that the women respond enthusiastically to group instruction and the few meetings we have been able to hold have made the women much more independent in a technical way. They are gradually becoming more expert in the mechanics of weaving due to the rigid campaign held throughout THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI ar for looms in perfect work--Eder and the emphasis put on trly stages of warping, beamnd threading.

This [ am giving the weaving only. From June 1, 1928, to May 17, 1929, we have bought from the women $6,711.59 worth of weaving. More women have their own warping bars so only fifty-nine warps have been made on the school bars. Between September 18, 1928, and December 15, 1928, and February 11, 1929, and May 17, 1929, there have been 621 calls on weaving business only and I have made 117 calls in the homes. The school class was successful. Alice McCarter taught the class practical weaving and I gave the notebook work. There were seven in the class, seventh and eighth grade girls. They paid for the materials they used by weaving towels and selling them to the school. Alice helped me in many other ways and proved to be a valuable assistant. I have tried to spread out the weaving among more families by limiting each home to one loom and keeping the weaving in Gatlinburg and vicinity. There are four young girls weaving this summer to earn money to go to high school next fall, making a total of fifty weavers this year. From my experience I believe that to supervise fifty women and to visit fifty homes located in various degrees of distance and accessibility is all that one person can do successfully. The work seems to be at a good place to pass on to someone else. There have been the usual amount of trials and tribulations, jealousy among the weavers, etc., but I have enjoyed my work here to the utmost and I regret that I have to give it up. Respectfully submitted, WINOGENE B.

        THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI ese courses were financed partly the state and partly by those ing the course. The exhibit at Gatlinburg Fair showed what week of sewing had accornshed. The home economics work closed the year at the end of the school m, no community classes being -ried on during the vacation. ks Katherine Watson married we a vacancy to fill at the end of school year. Miss Mary Rachel mstrong, University of Tenneswill take Katherine's place and, less present plans fail, will devote 7 entire time to home economics : cool classes in the morning and nmunity classes in the afternoon. already a full program is being rked out for the new year and we ill be glad to again take up these nmunity classes that we feel are very worth while. SGRICULTURE AND FARM SHOP [n writing a report of this departnt we have to remember that Mr. ittil has had so many different es of work outside of school rou e that we wonder he has been e to accomplish one-half that he n Smith Hughes agriculture !re is a school program that takes morning, each class having two -iods every day. This corre-)nds to the home economics pro-Lm. The afternoons should be en over to community work such junior poultry clubs, spraying pruning of orchards, advising stock and crops, veterinary ad e and treatment, and in fact do-; about everything called for. e shop work is along the line practical farm aid, making wag-beds and wheel barrows, self feeders for chickens and pigs, harness repairing, care of tools, etc. Each boy from the seventh grade up has a home project which he keeps an accurate record of, under the supervision of the teacher. These are varied. Some boys take a pig for a project, some a cow, others have crop projects. Many take poultry. The past two years the building program and other improvements have taken much of Mr. Mattil's time as he has supervised all these. It has been a real regret to him and to us that the educational work in nearby communities where he had had clubs and classes had to be dropped for this but no person could have handled both. In addition to these there is the farm to supervise and the student labor to keep in touch with. After seven years spent in organizing and building up this department Mr. Mattil feels he must give up teaching. We will have a hard task to fill his place, in fact shall not try to find anyone who can shoulder so much. He has done an outstanding piece of work which is recognized and appreciated by all. With the beginning of the new school year we shall go back to a distinct school program in this department, endeavoring to keep the outside things entirely separate from the work that rightfully be-longs to this department. For a year or more Mr. Mattil has been carrying on a very interesting piece of work independent of the school, yet somewhat associated with it too. The demands for antiques were so insistent he finally fitted up the old barn, near the school building, as a shop; putting an electric system and motors, REPORTS OF OFFICERS wood working machinery, etc., and employed from one to five boys to refinish old furniture and reproduce crickets, book shelves, tables, and in fact many different kinds of things which are sold in. the Arrow-craft Shop. The training these boys have had in the shop has been of the best and we only hope that Mr. Mattil has been able to at least come out even financially with the proposition. There is no doubt but that this has had a great influence on the furniture makers of the community for they are now bringing in better furniture than ever before. I am sure that eventually the school will want to take this over but at the present time we are only too glad to have Mr. Mattil want to keep it. FARM AND STUDENT LABOR The report of the farm and of the student labor is most satisfactory. More has been raised in the garden for the table, stock well cared for, fields in better condition, the place showing improvement generally. We are asked many times what we keep on the farm. We have three horses, one for farm work, two for the nurse and teachers. Four cows, one registered heifer gotten this past year, a registered Jersey bull, five Berkshire hogs, Barred Rock poultry, two Shropshire sheep gotten this year. About 100 hens are kept during the win-ter. At present we have nearly 1,000 little chicks, some to keep, most to be sold during the summer for ' fryers. Our incubators and brooders do service for the whole community. The farm and the student laboris all looked after by Otha Rea under the supervision and plann of Mr. Mattil. Otha is a ma: hand with the boys and as he been here a long time he is tl~ oughly familiar with Mr. Mat methods and can take a great of responsibility. Otha has b away because of illness for the five months and the work has b done by a former dormitory who has shown himself very c able. Having dormitory boys 1 year who had been here some t. has been a great help for all h shown themselves so very depe able and willing during this h siege. DORMITORIES Each year we are more fully c winced that the time and money u in supervising and providing a home life for our students who too far from the school to walk b and forth is well spent. The year we have had from six to boys and from eight to twelve g in the dormitories. Each stud has had regular hours of labor practically have had to look out all school expenses without any from home. Three boys had homes so their problems were larger ; how to earn enough fo new pair of overalls or shirt c hair cut in addition to all other penses. More than half of the mitory students finished their w here this spring so these places be filled this fall by new pupils. We have been most fortunat, having Mrs. Morgan in the g dormitory and to take care of meals for all this large family Iv] numbers now from thirty-five forty-five all the time. Mrs. I\ gan has planned splendid meals her care and training of the THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI all that anyone could ask. difficult task and one that day and night for the seven the week. The girls are they can be, though, and organ has thoroughly en-r year with them. Not least asks has been training local o were willing but inexperi-3 cooks. Two young girls 1ne the cooking the entire the assistance of the dol.-cirls. e, one of the most valuable f work was done last sum-.n addition was built to the Cottage, making a large and 2nt kitchen and over that a )m to be used for dormitory. [e range that had done fan).-rice for twelve years was nto the new home economics id a large range gotten, also water tank to replace the te, the old wooden ice box laced by a secondhand but od Frigidaire, all of which en a joy. We wonder how along with the outgrown as long as we did. But hen forty people came the August this was all in a upheaval, the old refriger-:ing under the tree, no kitchto walk on and everything like condition. This is a attired and willing family and everyone did his best le trying circumstances. By of the first month there was )f being settled and the secath brought real peace. lumbing and lighting for the t were all done by our own 'here is one other job to be ere this summer. Due to in family in the past few .e septic tank built ten years ago is inadequate and a new one must be put in this summer with new sewage lines. That will also be done by our men here. Mother made the move from the girls' to the boys' dormitory last fall and found the boys as nice to deal with as the girls. Discipline in either dormitory is not difficult but when one is willing and interested she can find plenty to do at either place and that kind of work requires being constantly with it. The past year two rooms in the teachers' cottage have been used by the boys, one for a dressing and wash room, one for a clubroom. The cottage in which they lived was too far for them to get to during the day. This summer we have rented the Jim Reagan cottage, which ad-joins our property and is near enough for all the needs of the boys. While the cottage is small the lo-cation so near the school will repay any other inconveniences they may have. The same schedule of work has been held to this year as last, the girls getting experience in practically every kind of work pertaining to homemaking, the boys in every-thing relating to stock and farm as well as general repair and up-keep work. LOCAL LABOR Not only the student labor but all the outside work has been done more satisfactorily the past year than ever before. Arlie Watson has taken care of furnaces and odd tasks during the winter, during the spring and summer has had a wonderful garden (which i used to supply our tables and also families who live in the Burg during the summer) and of course kept up many other duties. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 79 He and Otha Reagan make a fine team. Ernest Reagan continues to be with us and is the man for wiring, plumbing, repairing anything and everything. Two local girls who received some training in the evening class in home economics have done the cooking. Lillie Reagan continues as the nurse's assistant. We have eight local people on the pay roll and are proud of every one of them. WEAVING Again we can report continued growth in this department. While there have been the usual number of new products added to the Shop, things beautiful and decidedly sale-able, there has been a marked development in the real knowledge of the mechanics and art of weaving among the women. It has taken great effort to keep the weaving divided as equally and evenly among the people as possible and during the year forty-six women wove for the school, also four high school girls earned money in this way to continue school next year. Supervising weaving in fifty homes is a full-time task but the products show how well it is done. In addition to the individual instruction there have been six group meetings, with from sixteen to thirty women in attendance. These are possible since the new weaving room is finished. The new weaving, office, and storage rooms are almost too good to be true, and have relieved the stress" and strain in that department and other places too. Last spring the Smith Hughes vocational funds reimbursed us for the instruction given the afternoon class of women and with this money we employed Alice McCarter thisyear as assistant to Miss Redding. Alice is one of our local girls who has woven for us for years and is called the "loom doctor" because of being so expert in diagnosing and treating loom troubles of all kinds. I am glad to report that once again we have our regular classes in weaving for our school girls. The seventh and eighth grade girls have had two periods each day during the year, Alice and Miss Red-ding doing the teaching. Four new looms were gotten before school opened and three others rebuilt. With new weaving room and new looms, the results were most satisfactory. We are expecting reimbursement from the state again and hope that Alice will be able to continue her work another year. Weaving in the homes continues through every month of the year. Beginning with the first of January they start planning and working out new patterns and products for the next Christmas sales. There are still many more women who would like to weave but the present number is all that can be taken care of by the present weaving and Arrow-craft staffs. Both departments are working now to full capacity and it will be necessary after another year or two to discuss future development. The remarkable growth and development of the weaving department the past four years shows how efficient Winogene Redding has been and what a loss the school will sustain by her leaving. She has a thorough knowledge of her work and a most sympathetic understanding of the women with whom she has dealings and they have responded to all instruction and ad-vice remarkably well.

Mr. Mattil's shop, where finishing is done, has shown the local men such a marked difference between indifferently made furniture and that made from well seasoned wood, carefully put together and sanded and ready to be finished, that the men themselves have made marked progress in their work. The shop handles quite a good many finished articles as well as the unfinished stools and chairs. Although our main broom maker moved where he could "see the trucks pass all day and hear them of a night" other makers have been developed so we still.can supply the demand. The Gift Shop is not open on Sundays, to the dismay of a great many Pi Phis as well as other tourists, but we have felt we should take this stand. Last fall new price lists were printed and this spring an attractive cut has been made for all Arrow-craft products. The expense of the Arrowcraft Shop, the weaving department, part of the office expense, and extra help necessary during the rush season is met by the industrial department and we feel sure that all this considered there will be a profit again this year. But were we able to only come out even we would feel it all worth while. The $22,000 in cash paid all these weavers, basket, furniture and broom makers, quilters, hookers, and tufters means a real livelihood to one hundred families. Clubs and shop have been able to work together better than ever before each having a better under-standing of the needs of the other. No other school I know of has the splendid market we have and we surely value it most highly. All we REPORTS OF OFFICERS 81 have said concerning splendid club cooperation is sincere. ADMINISTRATION AND PUBLICITY Again, in this department as well as others, the same policies have been followed as in the year previous. The Gatlinburg News has been sent out each month to many local people, all officers of the fraternity, to each settlement chairman of the clubs, to those on the isolated alum-n lists, and to a good many individuals. With this has gone a let-ter from the school telling of the various departments and activities. These letters have also gone to the active chapters. An effort has been made to keep the letters short enough to be read easily and quickly at club and chapter meetings. With the increased business of the Arrowcraft there has been more and more to do in the office. A good many old accounts that have been on the books for years have been settled and the new accounts have been settled more promptly. The large business carried on and the tremendous amount of money necessarily advanced to maintain the department mean that we have had to have payments made more promptly than in former years. Clubs and individuals have responded splendily. Each year the student labor ac-counts are carried in a more business-like manner by both pupils and school and that again brings much added office work. The annual Mountain Workers Conference met in Knoxville the first week in April and a number of our staff attended some of the sessions at least. The conference isalways an inspiration and the contacts made with those from other schools is most helpful and pleasant. Following the conference we had the usual number of visitors to our school. In the fall I was in Berea four days, spending the entire time in observing work in various departments. Miss Cooke, Miss Allen, Miss Moore, and Mr. Mattil also visited Berea College. We received a great help in the line of publicity this year when Mr. and Mrs. Charles Rogers, of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, published and gave to the school for distribution, 10,000 copies of a leaflet telling of the history and activities of the school. This has met a long-felt need. COUNTY HEALTH UNIT Again I want to explain the way in which we cooperate with the county in the maintenance of a health unit. Instead of paying the nurse's salary directly to her it goes through the state health department, with appropriations from one other school in the county and from the county court. These funds are matched by state and federal funds, making a sufficient income for a county nurse, county health physician, and sanitary specialist these in addition to the nurses in the two schools. The state also furnishes free typhoid, smallpox, toxin-antitoxin serums, and other supplies. There is every promise of the best unit this year that we have ever had and the big objective for the year is sanitating the entire county. For this big task the state is furnishing additional assistance to the present staff.

The )f seeing that every home, , and church has a sanitary is a sufficient piece of work to keep two men busy for months to come. Yet sanitation is the thing needed and I believe that a reason-able amount of cooperation will come from the people. The additional appropriation from the county court is providing men for this extra work. Our nurse now has a car, the state paying the upkeep of it. While a car will not take the place of a horse it many times saves a great deal of time and hard riding and with so many better roads seems a necessity. It also is a great convenience in taking patients to Knoxville for examination and treatment as the school truck is not always available nor very comfortable for trips of that kind. Six first year high school girls took the course in home nursing and care of the sick and received state certificates. During the summer Frances has organized two Little Mothers classes. These meet two afternoons each week and undoubtedly are the cutest things you ever saw. She gives the children instruction in how to care for their baby brothers and sisters and it is a course that some of the older ones might be proud to take. Two high school girls who had taken the home hygiene and care of the sick course assisted at the last tonsil clinic and demonstrated that their study had not been spent in vain. Two children were taken to the Trachoma Hospital for treatment and several others were given examinations. A Knoxville specialist gave two days for examining eyes and fitting glasses, saving us many hard trips to Knoxville with children. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 83 COMMUNITY It often seems that we do very little in real community work, yet we probably touch the people much more than we realize. Our crying need these days is a real social worker, one who can give Saturdays and Sundays to the young people who spend their time in the Burg with nothing to do. Library and reading room should be kept open. Books and magazines are here but no one with time enough to devote to keeping playrooms and reading rooms open. During the winter the auditorium was used by the community basket-ball team, Mr. Overton giving much of his time to their practice and games. There have been movies two nights each week since the first of May and they will continue through the summer. This year Arlie Watson and Ernest Reagan are the managers. It is difficult to always get the kind of films we want but on the whole the pictures are fairly good. Old Timers Day is one of the great events of the year, bringing many families in for a real get-together day. The Gatlinburg Fair continues to be the big day of the year. Between 500 and 600 school pupils from Gatlinburg and nearby communities join in the school parade and take part in athletic events during the day. The exhibits are of a high grade and truly "a good time is had by all." We believe it would be worth while to hold it two days in-stead of one. Our Christmas entertainment and tree, the plays during the school year always bring a house full of attentive people. It is our plan tohave more in the line of entertainment and educational addresses now that we have an auditorium. The university and state departments are always more than willing to be of help. Several teachers have had Sunday School classes and usually some at-tend the preaching services which now come twice a month instead of only once. The country church never does develop as fast as school and business do, unfortunately, yet there is a wonderful field waiting for someone to work in. Even though good roads and cars make it very easy for us and for the people here to take their recreation elsewhere we all feel that there is a great need for the home and community social life. EMMA HARPER TURNER CENTER SUGARLANDS The extension school and community work at Sugarlands continues to be one of our most interesting pieces of work. Emily Burton joined the Sugar-lands staff, after ten years in the Gatlinburg school. Eva Hathaway returned for her second year there. Mrs. Dowell left the Burg and be-came housemother and community worker in Sugarlands. These made a fine team. The two girls had the school work, and of course much community work too. Mrs. Dowell took care of the home, taught cooking and sewing, and helped with different outside things. In the winter Mrs. Dowell spent a week at the University of Tennessee for the farm women's short course and came back with plenty of ideas to work out with the local women. One was the making of rugs, hooked and braided.

The work in a small center is mighty interesting. You have your own home life with a small family, you come close to the people around you and it seems as though you can see more being accomplished from day to day than in a larger center. Perhaps we in Gatlinburg sometimes are a little envious. PERMANENT IMPROVEMENTS AND REPAIRS 1928-29 Stuart Cottage : reroof, laundry improved and heated, new water heater and tank installed, coal storage made.

The building and improvement program of the past two years has been a heavy one but it is pra.eti.. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 85 cally accomplished. It will take careful planning for another two years to get it all paid for and into anything like an easy financial condition but it will come and in the meantime we know that there will be the best possible response from clubs and chapters and we in turn will be as careful as possible of the expenditures here. Our school has never had many large gifts from individuals and even a building pro-gram is carried on largely from the regular donations of the year which make up the budget. No extra drives for funds have been made and it is a real accomplishment to have the new building as nearly paid for as it is under these circumstances. During the winter the treasury was in a most pitiful condition and it was necessary to give a cry of distress. It surely was answered and month by month funds have come in to keep us going but it continues to be a hard struggle for the treasurer. All are glad that this year is behind us and we can start on a new one. .A big task brings a challenge that no doubt is good for us all. Again I want to express my appreciation of the help that has come from officers, clubs, and chapters and for the splendid cooperation of each one on the staff. Each letter, each visit, and each check has helped more than you can realize. Respectfully submitted, EvELYN BISHOP ARROWCRAFT REPORT So much attention has been given in the past few years to the finding for and marketing of the Arrow-craft products that very little atten-tion has been given to those who make the products especially the furniture and basket makers. This past year things have been so organized that we have known bet-ter what we wanted the people to make. The clubs are becoming more familiar with the products and know better what they can and can-not sell. Their orders have come in earlier and they have been free in saying what they felt were best sellers. With every order there has been much correspondence which we feel sure has resulted in better understanding between the clubs and the shop and has been of in-valuable help in timely final settlements. By appealing to the people's pride we have been able to bring up the standards of the baskets. They are beginning to realize they are only hurting themselves when they make a poor basket. When.two or three arrive at the same time you can always hear them criticising one another's baskets bragging on the good points at times but more often pointing out the bad ones. In this way I feel they have helped one another more than we could ever have, regardless of how much we might have talked and scolded. I believe that Mr. Mattil's shop has done more to bring up the standard of the furniture than any-thing ever has or ever could have done. For over two years I talked seasoned wood, sand paper, and, a lot of care in making but I didn't get very far. After Mr. Mattil started his shop I had some things finished to use as samples. The furniture makers seemed amazed to think the things they made "just old common settin' chairs" could be made to look so pretty. One comment THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI : "I 'low that's pretty enough t in anybody's house." It Lied that they always had the that furniture was just rough f that didn't matter much and re wasn't any need in spending t of time on it. One of the best :ers seemed very interested in ing out how it was done, spend-an entire morning asking ques-.s. My curiosity was aroused so ;ked him what he was planning .o. Then he told me he was maksome black walnut chairs for [self and was going to finish n. I felt then that something really been accomplished. Just long we will be able to get the kets and chairs no one knows as 1y of the people have sold out the Park and of course that ins they can no longer cut the )d. here is just one woman and her ghter that do the tufting on the [I mats and bed spreads. She ught her first things to the Shop rly two years ago and they were ful attempts. She appealed to s's sympathy and by encouraging [ suggestions as to colors, etc., we re been able to help her until now one could ask for lovelier things n those she brings in. Ve have had our first quilts this r and have been very fortunate vetting them. Instead of starting h an inexperienced person we re begun with a master quilter. s. Hatcher and her mother-in-., from Wears Valley, do the Ming and I have never seen love-. We have only the full bed size its but hope to eventually work aby crib covers, comforts, etc. hrough Mrs. Dowell's effort we .e had a few hooked mats from Sugarlands. However, we hope to concentrate on braided rugs there and leave the hooking to the women who have been doing it for so long. We have never had any braided rugs but feel there is a market for them. The buying requires more time than it once did, for in these busy days we do not have the opportunity for home visiting and our greatest contact comes through the Shop visiting. This year we have had two exhibits at fairs one at the East Tennessee Division State Fair and one at the Tri-State Fair at Memphis. It was the first exhibit we had had at Knoxville of our industrial products. The fair association there, was not allowed to pay the expenses of the exhibit but did give us a premium of $75 which took care of all expenses. The alumnae club of Memphis had charge of the exhibit there (which was the fourth we have had) and bore all expenses. At both places a loom was used to demonstrate. At last we have a tag to mark all Arrowcraft products and one which everyone will like. I feel sure the clubs will welcome these. The price list was revised in the summer and this, with a letter of explanation and a club, or wholesale price list, was sent to each club in the fall. The circulars given to us by Mr. Rogers, of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, have been a world of help as hardly any-one comes into the Shop that doesn't want something that tells about the school. While the gross amount shipped isn't so much greater this year than last there has been less returned for credit. This is a result of smaller orders to more clubs. To date the gross sales have been REPORTS OF OFFICERS 87 $26,201.55 returned for credit $5,981.18. Net business $20,220.37. To ninety-eight people bringing things to the Shop we have paid $22,374.53, an average of $228.31 to each person. Taking the fifty weavers out and the $6,711.59 paid them, it leaves forty-eight basket makers, broom tyers, furniture makers, hookers, tufters and quilters receiving a total of $15,662.94. Everything recommended last year has been carried out with the exception of the water and toilet facilities in the Shop. With so many other improvements being made there never seemed to be a time when the necessary labor was available. We expect to get this done during the summer. There is only one recommendation I feel should be made this year. That is for a Shop in the new Mountain View Hotel which is to be erected this coming winter. I have talked to Mr. Huff about it and he says there is a space in the hotel for such a shop as we would want and that as long as the school is here and wants the space no one else shall have it. I feel sure the space can be leased for a nominal sum. We know that we are not getting our share of the tourist trade and this shop may be a possible solution. There are pros and cons that will need to be carefully discussed at committee meeting. Respectfully submitted, LADELLE ALLEN WEAVING REPORT Another year has come and gone and it is time once more for an annual report. This year I feel as if somethingdefinite has been accomplished among the women of the community. It is hard to put into words, as it is more a feeling of satisfaction that the educational goal that I have been striving toward for four years is in sight at last, than it is a condition that can be seen or expressed in so many sentences. It may be due in part to knowing the women more thoroughly, realizing the shortcomings of each woman and so knowing just how to handle the individual cases in order to give everyone the weaving help best suited to make her happy and satisfied. This only comes from long acquaintance and congenial workers. Working conditions are ideal now and have helped wonderfully to make the work run smoothly. The office, supply room, and large weaving room are in constant use. Sup-plies can be kept in better condition and more easily handled, saving much time. The office makes a convenient and necessary place for the women to bring in their weaving, and get material and receive directions for their weekly weaving. The class room is used the year around: for classes during the school year; several women use the warping bars and it gives a place where the women of the en-tire community can gather for group instruction, a most necessary part of the work, and until this year not available because of lack of space. I have found that the women respond enthusiastically to group instruction and the few meetings we have been able to hold have made the women much more independent in a technical way. They are gradually becoming more expert in the mechanics of weaving due to the rigid campaign held throughout THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI ar for looms in perfect work--Eder and the emphasis put on trly stages of warping, beamnd threading.

This [ am giving the weaving only. From June 1, 1928, to May 17, 1929, we have bought from the women $6,711.59 worth of weaving. More women have their own warping bars so only fifty-nine warps have been made on the school bars. Between September 18, 1928, and December 15, 1928, and February 11, 1929, and May 17, 1929, there have been 621 calls on weaving business only and I have made 117 calls in the homes. The school class was successful. Alice McCarter taught the class practical weaving and I gave the notebook work. There were seven in the class, seventh and eighth grade girls. They paid for the materials they used by weaving towels and selling them to the school. Alice helped me in many other ways and proved to be a valuable assistant. I have tried to spread out the weaving among more families by limiting each home to one loom and keeping the weaving in Gatlinburg and vicinity. There are four young girls weaving this summer to earn money to go to high school next fall, making a total of fifty weavers this year. From my experience I believe that to supervise fifty women and to visit fifty homes located in various degrees of distance and accessibility is all that one person can do successfully. The work seems to be at a good place to pass on to someone else. There have been the usual amount of trials and tribulations, jealousy among the weavers, etc., but I have enjoyed my work here to the utmost and I regret that I have to give it up.

The girls are they can be, though, and organ has thoroughly en-r year with them. Not least asks has been training local o were willing but inexperi-3 cooks. Two young girls 1ne the cooking the entire the assistance of the dol.-cirls. e, one of the most valuable f work was done last sum-.n addition was built to the Cottage, making a large and 2nt kitchen and over that a )m to be used for dormitory. [e range that had done fan).-rice for twelve years was nto the new home economics id a large range gotten, also water tank to replace the te, the old wooden ice box laced by a secondhand but od Frigidaire, all of which en a joy. We wonder how along with the outgrown as long as we did. But hen forty people came the August this was all in a upheaval, the old refriger-:ing under the tree, no kitchto walk on and everything like condition. This is a attired and willing family and everyone did his best le trying circumstances. By of the first month there was )f being settled and the secath brought real peace. lumbing and lighting for the t were all done by our own 'here is one other job to be ere this summer. Due to in family in the past few .e septic tank built ten years ago is inadequate and a new one must be put in this summer with new sewage lines. That will also be done by our men here. Mother made the move from the girls' to the boys' dormitory last fall and found the boys as nice to deal with as the girls. Discipline in either dormitory is not difficult but when one is willing and interested she can find plenty to do at either place and that kind of work requires being constantly with it. The past year two rooms in the teachers' cottage have been used by the boys, one for a dressing and wash room, one for a clubroom. The cottage in which they lived was too far for them to get to during the day. This summer we have rented the Jim Reagan cottage, which ad-joins our property and is near enough for all the needs of the boys. While the cottage is small the lo-cation so near the school will repay any other inconveniences they may have. The same schedule of work has been held to this year as last, the girls getting experience in practically every kind of work pertaining to homemaking, the boys in every-thing relating to stock and farm as well as general repair and up-keep work. LOCAL LABOR Not only the student labor but all the outside work has been done more satisfactorily the past year than ever before. Arlie Watson has taken care of furnaces and odd tasks during the winter, during the spring and summer has had a wonderful garden (which i used to supply our tables and also families who live in the Burg during the summer) and of course kept up many other duties. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 79 He and Otha Reagan make a fine team. Ernest Reagan continues to be with us and is the man for wiring, plumbing, repairing anything and everything. Two local girls who received some training in the evening class in home economics have done the cooking. Lillie Reagan continues as the nurse's assistant. We have eight local people on the pay roll and are proud of every one of them. WEAVING Again we can report continued growth in this department. While there have been the usual number of new products added to the Shop, things beautiful and decidedly sale-able, there has been a marked development in the real knowledge of the mechanics and art of weaving among the women. It has taken great effort to keep the weaving divided as equally and evenly among the people as possible and during the year forty-six women wove for the school, also four high school girls earned money in this way to continue school next year. Supervising weaving in fifty homes is a full-time task but the products show how well it is done. In addition to the individual instruction there have been six group meetings, with from sixteen to thirty women in attendance. These are possible since the new weaving room is finished. The new weaving, office, and storage rooms are almost too good to be true, and have relieved the stress" and strain in that department and other places too. Last spring the Smith Hughes vocational funds reimbursed us for the instruction given the afternoon class of women and with this money we employed Alice McCarter thisyear as assistant to Miss Redding. Alice is one of our local girls who has woven for us for years and is called the "loom doctor" because of being so expert in diagnosing and treating loom troubles of all kinds. I am glad to report that once again we have our regular classes in weaving for our school girls. The seventh and eighth grade girls have had two periods each day during the year, Alice and Miss Red-ding doing the teaching. Four new looms were gotten before school opened and three others rebuilt. With new weaving room and new looms, the results were most satisfactory. We are expecting reimbursement from the state again and hope that Alice will be able to continue her work another year. Weaving in the homes continues through every month of the year. Beginning with the first of January they start planning and working out new patterns and products for the next Christmas sales. There are still many more women who would like to weave but the present number is all that can be taken care of by the present weaving and Arrow-craft staffs. Both departments are working now to full capacity and it will be necessary after another year or two to discuss future development. The remarkable growth and development of the weaving department the past four years shows how efficient Winogene Redding has been and what a loss the school will sustain by her leaving. She has a thorough knowledge of her work and a most sympathetic understanding of the women with whom she has dealings and they have responded to all instruction and ad-vice remarkably well. Weaving THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI .s are not easy to find but we ^ing to have one here by Aug ARROWCRAFT Arrowcraft again shows [ development.

Each year new are added to the list and ely are proud of the things t, feeling they compare most ply with those from other quantity of basket business bout the same but the quality les made improves steadily. iture making is on the in-Ind the chairs made are of 1perior grade. Mr. Mattil's shop, where finishing is done, has shown the local men such a marked difference between indifferently made furniture and that made from well seasoned wood, carefully put together and sanded and ready to be finished, that the men themselves have made marked progress in their work. The shop handles quite a good many finished articles as well as the unfinished stools and chairs. Although our main broom maker moved where he could "see the trucks pass all day and hear them of a night" other makers have been developed so we still.can supply the demand. The Gift Shop is not open on Sundays, to the dismay of a great many Pi Phis as well as other tourists, but we have felt we should take this stand. Last fall new price lists were printed and this spring an attractive cut has been made for all Arrow-craft products. The expense of the Arrowcraft Shop, the weaving department, part of the office expense, and extra help necessary during the rush season is met by the industrial department and we feel sure that all this considered there will be a profit again this year. But were we able to only come out even we would feel it all worth while. The $22,000 in cash paid all these weavers, basket, furniture and broom makers, quilters, hookers, and tufters means a real livelihood to one hundred families. Clubs and shop have been able to work together better than ever before each having a better under-standing of the needs of the other. No other school I know of has the splendid market we have and we surely value it most highly. All we REPORTS OF OFFICERS 81 have said concerning splendid club cooperation is sincere. ADMINISTRATION AND PUBLICITY Again, in this department as well as others, the same policies have been followed as in the year previous. The Gatlinburg News has been sent out each month to many local people, all officers of the fraternity, to each settlement chairman of the clubs, to those on the isolated alum-n lists, and to a good many individuals. With this has gone a let-ter from the school telling of the various departments and activities. These letters have also gone to the active chapters. An effort has been made to keep the letters short enough to be read easily and quickly at club and chapter meetings. With the increased business of the Arrowcraft there has been more and more to do in the office. A good many old accounts that have been on the books for years have been settled and the new accounts have been settled more promptly. The large business carried on and the tremendous amount of money necessarily advanced to maintain the department mean that we have had to have payments made more promptly than in former years. Clubs and individuals have responded splendily. Each year the student labor ac-counts are carried in a more business-like manner by both pupils and school and that again brings much added office work. The annual Mountain Workers Conference met in Knoxville the first week in April and a number of our staff attended some of the sessions at least. The conference isalways an inspiration and the contacts made with those from other schools is most helpful and pleasant. Following the conference we had the usual number of visitors to our school. In the fall I was in Berea four days, spending the entire time in observing work in various departments. Miss Cooke, Miss Allen, Miss Moore, and Mr. Mattil also visited Berea College. We received a great help in the line of publicity this year when Mr. and Mrs. Charles Rogers, of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, published and gave to the school for distribution, 10,000 copies of a leaflet telling of the history and activities of the school. This has met a long-felt need. COUNTY HEALTH UNIT Again I want to explain the way in which we cooperate with the county in the maintenance of a health unit. Instead of paying the nurse's salary directly to her it goes through the state health department, with appropriations from one other school in the county and from the county court. These funds are matched by state and federal funds, making a sufficient income for a county nurse, county health physician, and sanitary specialist these in addition to the nurses in the two schools. The state also furnishes free typhoid, smallpox, toxin-antitoxin serums, and other supplies. There is every promise of the best unit this year that we have ever had and the big objective for the year is sanitating the entire county. For this big task the state is furnishing additional assistance to the present staff.

A dentist comes out Knoxville one Saturday each . There has been one tonsil with eleven operations. Our health physician holds clinics .rious inoculations and assists he school program our nurse :o carry out in this district. :ounty health unit has set a sk for itself that of sanita-'or entire county. The )f seeing that every home, , and church has a sanitary is a sufficient piece of work to keep two men busy for months to come. Yet sanitation is the thing needed and I believe that a reason-able amount of cooperation will come from the people. The additional appropriation from the county court is providing men for this extra work. Our nurse now has a car, the state paying the upkeep of it. While a car will not take the place of a horse it many times saves a great deal of time and hard riding and with so many better roads seems a necessity. It also is a great convenience in taking patients to Knoxville for examination and treatment as the school truck is not always available nor very comfortable for trips of that kind. Six first year high school girls took the course in home nursing and care of the sick and received state certificates. During the summer Frances has organized two Little Mothers classes. These meet two afternoons each week and undoubtedly are the cutest things you ever saw. She gives the children instruction in how to care for their baby brothers and sisters and it is a course that some of the older ones might be proud to take. Two high school girls who had taken the home hygiene and care of the sick course assisted at the last tonsil clinic and demonstrated that their study had not been spent in vain. Two children were taken to the Trachoma Hospital for treatment and several others were given examinations. A Knoxville specialist gave two days for examining eyes and fitting glasses, saving us many hard trips to Knoxville with children. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 83 COMMUNITY It often seems that we do very little in real community work, yet we probably touch the people much more than we realize. Our crying need these days is a real social worker, one who can give Saturdays and Sundays to the young people who spend their time in the Burg with nothing to do. Library and reading room should be kept open. Books and magazines are here but no one with time enough to devote to keeping playrooms and reading rooms open. During the winter the auditorium was used by the community basket-ball team, Mr. Overton giving much of his time to their practice and games. There have been movies two nights each week since the first of May and they will continue through the summer. This year Arlie Watson and Ernest Reagan are the managers. It is difficult to always get the kind of films we want but on the whole the pictures are fairly good. Old Timers Day is one of the great events of the year, bringing many families in for a real get-together day. The Gatlinburg Fair continues to be the big day of the year. Between 500 and 600 school pupils from Gatlinburg and nearby communities join in the school parade and take part in athletic events during the day. The exhibits are of a high grade and truly "a good time is had by all." We believe it would be worth while to hold it two days in-stead of one. Our Christmas entertainment and tree, the plays during the school year always bring a house full of attentive people. It is our plan tohave more in the line of entertainment and educational addresses now that we have an auditorium. The university and state departments are always more than willing to be of help. Several teachers have had Sunday School classes and usually some at-tend the preaching services which now come twice a month instead of only once. The country church never does develop as fast as school and business do, unfortunately, yet there is a wonderful field waiting for someone to work in. Even though good roads and cars make it very easy for us and for the people here to take their recreation elsewhere we all feel that there is a great need for the home and community social life. EMMA HARPER TURNER CENTER SUGARLANDS The extension school and community work at Sugarlands continues to be one of our most interesting pieces of work. Emily Burton joined the Sugar-lands staff, after ten years in the Gatlinburg school. Eva Hathaway returned for her second year there. Mrs. Dowell left the Burg and be-came housemother and community worker in Sugarlands. These made a fine team. The two girls had the school work, and of course much community work too. Mrs. Dowell took care of the home, taught cooking and sewing, and helped with different outside things. In the winter Mrs. Dowell spent a week at the University of Tennessee for the farm women's short course and came back with plenty of ideas to work out with the local women. One was the making of rugs, hooked and braided. THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI e enrollment the past year in chool has been about eighty. ounty pays the salary in full of teacher, keeps up the necessary rs of the school building and ies the fuel.

The work in a small center is mighty interesting. You have your own home life with a small family, you come close to the people around you and it seems as though you can see more being accomplished from day to day than in a larger center. Perhaps we in Gatlinburg sometimes are a little envious. PERMANENT IMPROVEMENTS AND REPAIRS 1928-29 Stuart Cottage : reroof, laundry improved and heated, new water heater and tank installed, coal storage made.

The building and improvement program of the past two years has been a heavy one but it is pra.eti.. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 85 cally accomplished. It will take careful planning for another two years to get it all paid for and into anything like an easy financial condition but it will come and in the meantime we know that there will be the best possible response from clubs and chapters and we in turn will be as careful as possible of the expenditures here. Our school has never had many large gifts from individuals and even a building pro-gram is carried on largely from the regular donations of the year which make up the budget. No extra drives for funds have been made and it is a real accomplishment to have the new building as nearly paid for as it is under these circumstances. During the winter the treasury was in a most pitiful condition and it was necessary to give a cry of distress. It surely was answered and month by month funds have come in to keep us going but it continues to be a hard struggle for the treasurer. All are glad that this year is behind us and we can start on a new one. .A big task brings a challenge that no doubt is good for us all. Again I want to express my appreciation of the help that has come from officers, clubs, and chapters and for the splendid cooperation of each one on the staff. Each letter, each visit, and each check has helped more than you can realize. Respectfully submitted, EvELYN BISHOP ARROWCRAFT REPORT So much attention has been given in the past few years to the finding for and marketing of the Arrow-craft products that very little atten-tion has been given to those who make the products especially the furniture and basket makers. This past year things have been so organized that we have known bet-ter what we wanted the people to make. The clubs are becoming more familiar with the products and know better what they can and can-not sell. Their orders have come in earlier and they have been free in saying what they felt were best sellers. With every order there has been much correspondence which we feel sure has resulted in better understanding between the clubs and the shop and has been of in-valuable help in timely final settlements. By appealing to the people's pride we have been able to bring up the standards of the baskets. They are beginning to realize they are only hurting themselves when they make a poor basket. When.two or three arrive at the same time you can always hear them criticising one another's baskets bragging on the good points at times but more often pointing out the bad ones. In this way I feel they have helped one another more than we could ever have, regardless of how much we might have talked and scolded. I believe that Mr. Mattil's shop has done more to bring up the standard of the furniture than any-thing ever has or ever could have done. For over two years I talked seasoned wood, sand paper, and, a lot of care in making but I didn't get very far. After Mr. Mattil started his shop I had some things finished to use as samples. The furniture makers seemed amazed to think the things they made "just old common settin' chairs" could be made to look so pretty. One comment THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI : "I 'low that's pretty enough t in anybody's house." It Lied that they always had the that furniture was just rough f that didn't matter much and re wasn't any need in spending t of time on it. One of the best :ers seemed very interested in ing out how it was done, spend-an entire morning asking ques-.s. My curiosity was aroused so ;ked him what he was planning .o. Then he told me he was maksome black walnut chairs for [self and was going to finish n. I felt then that something really been accomplished. Just long we will be able to get the kets and chairs no one knows as 1y of the people have sold out the Park and of course that ins they can no longer cut the )d. here is just one woman and her ghter that do the tufting on the [I mats and bed spreads. She ught her first things to the Shop rly two years ago and they were ful attempts. She appealed to s's sympathy and by encouraging [ suggestions as to colors, etc., we re been able to help her until now one could ask for lovelier things n those she brings in. Ve have had our first quilts this r and have been very fortunate vetting them. Instead of starting h an inexperienced person we re begun with a master quilter. s. Hatcher and her mother-in-., from Wears Valley, do the Ming and I have never seen love-. We have only the full bed size its but hope to eventually work aby crib covers, comforts, etc. hrough Mrs. Dowell's effort we .e had a few hooked mats from Sugarlands. However, we hope to concentrate on braided rugs there and leave the hooking to the women who have been doing it for so long. We have never had any braided rugs but feel there is a market for them. The buying requires more time than it once did, for in these busy days we do not have the opportunity for home visiting and our greatest contact comes through the Shop visiting. This year we have had two exhibits at fairs one at the East Tennessee Division State Fair and one at the Tri-State Fair at Memphis. It was the first exhibit we had had at Knoxville of our industrial products. The fair association there, was not allowed to pay the expenses of the exhibit but did give us a premium of $75 which took care of all expenses. The alumnae club of Memphis had charge of the exhibit there (which was the fourth we have had) and bore all expenses. At both places a loom was used to demonstrate. At last we have a tag to mark all Arrowcraft products and one which everyone will like. I feel sure the clubs will welcome these. The price list was revised in the summer and this, with a letter of explanation and a club, or wholesale price list, was sent to each club in the fall. The circulars given to us by Mr. Rogers, of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, have been a world of help as hardly any-one comes into the Shop that doesn't want something that tells about the school. While the gross amount shipped isn't so much greater this year than last there has been less returned for credit. This is a result of smaller orders to more clubs. To date the gross sales have been REPORTS OF OFFICERS 87 $26,201.55 returned for credit $5,981.18. Net business $20,220.37. To ninety-eight people bringing things to the Shop we have paid $22,374.53, an average of $228.31 to each person. Taking the fifty weavers out and the $6,711.59 paid them, it leaves forty-eight basket makers, broom tyers, furniture makers, hookers, tufters and quilters receiving a total of $15,662.94. Everything recommended last year has been carried out with the exception of the water and toilet facilities in the Shop. With so many other improvements being made there never seemed to be a time when the necessary labor was available. We expect to get this done during the summer. There is only one recommendation I feel should be made this year. That is for a Shop in the new Mountain View Hotel which is to be erected this coming winter. I have talked to Mr. Huff about it and he says there is a space in the hotel for such a shop as we would want and that as long as the school is here and wants the space no one else shall have it. I feel sure the space can be leased for a nominal sum. We know that we are not getting our share of the tourist trade and this shop may be a possible solution. There are pros and cons that will need to be carefully discussed at committee meeting. Respectfully submitted, LADELLE ALLEN WEAVING REPORT Another year has come and gone and it is time once more for an annual report. This year I feel as if somethingdefinite has been accomplished among the women of the community. It is hard to put into words, as it is more a feeling of satisfaction that the educational goal that I have been striving toward for four years is in sight at last, than it is a condition that can be seen or expressed in so many sentences. It may be due in part to knowing the women more thoroughly, realizing the shortcomings of each woman and so knowing just how to handle the individual cases in order to give everyone the weaving help best suited to make her happy and satisfied. This only comes from long acquaintance and congenial workers. Working conditions are ideal now and have helped wonderfully to make the work run smoothly. The office, supply room, and large weaving room are in constant use. Sup-plies can be kept in better condition and more easily handled, saving much time. The office makes a convenient and necessary place for the women to bring in their weaving, and get material and receive directions for their weekly weaving. The class room is used the year around: for classes during the school year; several women use the warping bars and it gives a place where the women of the en-tire community can gather for group instruction, a most necessary part of the work, and until this year not available because of lack of space. I have found that the women respond enthusiastically to group instruction and the few meetings we have been able to hold have made the women much more independent in a technical way. They are gradually becoming more expert in the mechanics of weaving due to the rigid campaign held throughout THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI ar for looms in perfect work--Eder and the emphasis put on trly stages of warping, beamnd threading. They can take ions about draft and pattern in an intelligent manner. ction of detail and a high a.rd of every part of the work axing a great deal to do with jlendicl grade of weaving the n bring to us. individual work done during revious years has prepared omen for this group instructs it laid a foundation which 5 it possible to absorb knowlin large portions.

This [ am giving the weaving only. From June 1, 1928, to May 17, 1929, we have bought from the women $6,711.59 worth of weaving. More women have their own warping bars so only fifty-nine warps have been made on the school bars. Between September 18, 1928, and December 15, 1928, and February 11, 1929, and May 17, 1929, there have been 621 calls on weaving business only and I have made 117 calls in the homes. The school class was successful. Alice McCarter taught the class practical weaving and I gave the notebook work. There were seven in the class, seventh and eighth grade girls. They paid for the materials they used by weaving towels and selling them to the school. Alice helped me in many other ways and proved to be a valuable assistant. I have tried to spread out the weaving among more families by limiting each home to one loom and keeping the weaving in Gatlinburg and vicinity. There are four young girls weaving this summer to earn money to go to high school next fall, making a total of fifty weavers this year. From my experience I believe that to supervise fifty women and to visit fifty homes located in various degrees of distance and accessibility is all that one person can do successfully. The work seems to be at a good place to pass on to someone else. There have been the usual amount of trials and tribulations, jealousy among the weavers, etc., but I have enjoyed my work here to the utmost and I regret that I have to give it up.

Mr. Mattil's shop, where finishing is done, has shown the local men such a marked difference between indifferently made furniture and that made from well seasoned wood, carefully put together and sanded and ready to be finished, that the men themselves have made marked progress in their work. The shop handles quite a good many finished articles as well as the unfinished stools and chairs. Although our main broom maker moved where he could "see the trucks pass all day and hear them of a night" other makers have been developed so we still.can supply the demand. The Gift Shop is not open on Sundays, to the dismay of a great many Pi Phis as well as other tourists, but we have felt we should take this stand. Last fall new price lists were printed and this spring an attractive cut has been made for all Arrow-craft products. The expense of the Arrowcraft Shop, the weaving department, part of the office expense, and extra help necessary during the rush season is met by the industrial department and we feel sure that all this considered there will be a profit again this year. But were we able to only come out even we would feel it all worth while. The $22,000 in cash paid all these weavers, basket, furniture and broom makers, quilters, hookers, and tufters means a real livelihood to one hundred families. Clubs and shop have been able to work together better than ever before each having a better under-standing of the needs of the other. No other school I know of has the splendid market we have and we surely value it most highly. All we REPORTS OF OFFICERS 81 have said concerning splendid club cooperation is sincere. ADMINISTRATION AND PUBLICITY Again, in this department as well as others, the same policies have been followed as in the year previous. The Gatlinburg News has been sent out each month to many local people, all officers of the fraternity, to each settlement chairman of the clubs, to those on the isolated alum-n lists, and to a good many individuals. With this has gone a let-ter from the school telling of the various departments and activities. These letters have also gone to the active chapters. An effort has been made to keep the letters short enough to be read easily and quickly at club and chapter meetings. With the increased business of the Arrowcraft there has been more and more to do in the office. A good many old accounts that have been on the books for years have been settled and the new accounts have been settled more promptly. The large business carried on and the tremendous amount of money necessarily advanced to maintain the department mean that we have had to have payments made more promptly than in former years. Clubs and individuals have responded splendily. Each year the student labor ac-counts are carried in a more business-like manner by both pupils and school and that again brings much added office work. The annual Mountain Workers Conference met in Knoxville the first week in April and a number of our staff attended some of the sessions at least. The conference isalways an inspiration and the contacts made with those from other schools is most helpful and pleasant. Following the conference we had the usual number of visitors to our school. In the fall I was in Berea four days, spending the entire time in observing work in various departments. Miss Cooke, Miss Allen, Miss Moore, and Mr. Mattil also visited Berea College. We received a great help in the line of publicity this year when Mr. and Mrs. Charles Rogers, of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, published and gave to the school for distribution, 10,000 copies of a leaflet telling of the history and activities of the school. This has met a long-felt need. COUNTY HEALTH UNIT Again I want to explain the way in which we cooperate with the county in the maintenance of a health unit. Instead of paying the nurse's salary directly to her it goes through the state health department, with appropriations from one other school in the county and from the county court. These funds are matched by state and federal funds, making a sufficient income for a county nurse, county health physician, and sanitary specialist these in addition to the nurses in the two schools. The state also furnishes free typhoid, smallpox, toxin-antitoxin serums, and other supplies. There is every promise of the best unit this year that we have ever had and the big objective for the year is sanitating the entire county. For this big task the state is furnishing additional assistance to the present staff.

The )f seeing that every home, , and church has a sanitary is a sufficient piece of work to keep two men busy for months to come. Yet sanitation is the thing needed and I believe that a reason-able amount of cooperation will come from the people. The additional appropriation from the county court is providing men for this extra work. Our nurse now has a car, the state paying the upkeep of it. While a car will not take the place of a horse it many times saves a great deal of time and hard riding and with so many better roads seems a necessity. It also is a great convenience in taking patients to Knoxville for examination and treatment as the school truck is not always available nor very comfortable for trips of that kind. Six first year high school girls took the course in home nursing and care of the sick and received state certificates. During the summer Frances has organized two Little Mothers classes. These meet two afternoons each week and undoubtedly are the cutest things you ever saw. She gives the children instruction in how to care for their baby brothers and sisters and it is a course that some of the older ones might be proud to take. Two high school girls who had taken the home hygiene and care of the sick course assisted at the last tonsil clinic and demonstrated that their study had not been spent in vain. Two children were taken to the Trachoma Hospital for treatment and several others were given examinations. A Knoxville specialist gave two days for examining eyes and fitting glasses, saving us many hard trips to Knoxville with children. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 83 COMMUNITY It often seems that we do very little in real community work, yet we probably touch the people much more than we realize. Our crying need these days is a real social worker, one who can give Saturdays and Sundays to the young people who spend their time in the Burg with nothing to do. Library and reading room should be kept open. Books and magazines are here but no one with time enough to devote to keeping playrooms and reading rooms open. During the winter the auditorium was used by the community basket-ball team, Mr. Overton giving much of his time to their practice and games. There have been movies two nights each week since the first of May and they will continue through the summer. This year Arlie Watson and Ernest Reagan are the managers. It is difficult to always get the kind of films we want but on the whole the pictures are fairly good. Old Timers Day is one of the great events of the year, bringing many families in for a real get-together day. The Gatlinburg Fair continues to be the big day of the year. Between 500 and 600 school pupils from Gatlinburg and nearby communities join in the school parade and take part in athletic events during the day. The exhibits are of a high grade and truly "a good time is had by all." We believe it would be worth while to hold it two days in-stead of one. Our Christmas entertainment and tree, the plays during the school year always bring a house full of attentive people. It is our plan tohave more in the line of entertainment and educational addresses now that we have an auditorium. The university and state departments are always more than willing to be of help. Several teachers have had Sunday School classes and usually some at-tend the preaching services which now come twice a month instead of only once. The country church never does develop as fast as school and business do, unfortunately, yet there is a wonderful field waiting for someone to work in. Even though good roads and cars make it very easy for us and for the people here to take their recreation elsewhere we all feel that there is a great need for the home and community social life. EMMA HARPER TURNER CENTER SUGARLANDS The extension school and community work at Sugarlands continues to be one of our most interesting pieces of work. Emily Burton joined the Sugar-lands staff, after ten years in the Gatlinburg school. Eva Hathaway returned for her second year there. Mrs. Dowell left the Burg and be-came housemother and community worker in Sugarlands. These made a fine team. The two girls had the school work, and of course much community work too. Mrs. Dowell took care of the home, taught cooking and sewing, and helped with different outside things. In the winter Mrs. Dowell spent a week at the University of Tennessee for the farm women's short course and came back with plenty of ideas to work out with the local women. One was the making of rugs, hooked and braided.

The work in a small center is mighty interesting. You have your own home life with a small family, you come close to the people around you and it seems as though you can see more being accomplished from day to day than in a larger center. Perhaps we in Gatlinburg sometimes are a little envious. PERMANENT IMPROVEMENTS AND REPAIRS 1928-29 Stuart Cottage : reroof, laundry improved and heated, new water heater and tank installed, coal storage made.

The building and improvement program of the past two years has been a heavy one but it is pra.eti.. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 85 cally accomplished. It will take careful planning for another two years to get it all paid for and into anything like an easy financial condition but it will come and in the meantime we know that there will be the best possible response from clubs and chapters and we in turn will be as careful as possible of the expenditures here. Our school has never had many large gifts from individuals and even a building pro-gram is carried on largely from the regular donations of the year which make up the budget. No extra drives for funds have been made and it is a real accomplishment to have the new building as nearly paid for as it is under these circumstances. During the winter the treasury was in a most pitiful condition and it was necessary to give a cry of distress. It surely was answered and month by month funds have come in to keep us going but it continues to be a hard struggle for the treasurer. All are glad that this year is behind us and we can start on a new one. .A big task brings a challenge that no doubt is good for us all. Again I want to express my appreciation of the help that has come from officers, clubs, and chapters and for the splendid cooperation of each one on the staff. Each letter, each visit, and each check has helped more than you can realize. Respectfully submitted, EvELYN BISHOP ARROWCRAFT REPORT So much attention has been given in the past few years to the finding for and marketing of the Arrow-craft products that very little atten-tion has been given to those who make the products especially the furniture and basket makers. This past year things have been so organized that we have known bet-ter what we wanted the people to make. The clubs are becoming more familiar with the products and know better what they can and can-not sell. Their orders have come in earlier and they have been free in saying what they felt were best sellers. With every order there has been much correspondence which we feel sure has resulted in better understanding between the clubs and the shop and has been of in-valuable help in timely final settlements. By appealing to the people's pride we have been able to bring up the standards of the baskets. They are beginning to realize they are only hurting themselves when they make a poor basket. When.two or three arrive at the same time you can always hear them criticising one another's baskets bragging on the good points at times but more often pointing out the bad ones. In this way I feel they have helped one another more than we could ever have, regardless of how much we might have talked and scolded. I believe that Mr. Mattil's shop has done more to bring up the standard of the furniture than any-thing ever has or ever could have done. For over two years I talked seasoned wood, sand paper, and, a lot of care in making but I didn't get very far. After Mr. Mattil started his shop I had some things finished to use as samples. The furniture makers seemed amazed to think the things they made "just old common settin' chairs" could be made to look so pretty. One comment THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI : "I 'low that's pretty enough t in anybody's house." It Lied that they always had the that furniture was just rough f that didn't matter much and re wasn't any need in spending t of time on it. One of the best :ers seemed very interested in ing out how it was done, spend-an entire morning asking ques-.s. My curiosity was aroused so ;ked him what he was planning .o. Then he told me he was maksome black walnut chairs for [self and was going to finish n. I felt then that something really been accomplished. Just long we will be able to get the kets and chairs no one knows as 1y of the people have sold out the Park and of course that ins they can no longer cut the )d. here is just one woman and her ghter that do the tufting on the [I mats and bed spreads. She ught her first things to the Shop rly two years ago and they were ful attempts. She appealed to s's sympathy and by encouraging [ suggestions as to colors, etc., we re been able to help her until now one could ask for lovelier things n those she brings in. Ve have had our first quilts this r and have been very fortunate vetting them. Instead of starting h an inexperienced person we re begun with a master quilter. s. Hatcher and her mother-in-., from Wears Valley, do the Ming and I have never seen love-. We have only the full bed size its but hope to eventually work aby crib covers, comforts, etc. hrough Mrs. Dowell's effort we .e had a few hooked mats from Sugarlands. However, we hope to concentrate on braided rugs there and leave the hooking to the women who have been doing it for so long. We have never had any braided rugs but feel there is a market for them. The buying requires more time than it once did, for in these busy days we do not have the opportunity for home visiting and our greatest contact comes through the Shop visiting. This year we have had two exhibits at fairs one at the East Tennessee Division State Fair and one at the Tri-State Fair at Memphis. It was the first exhibit we had had at Knoxville of our industrial products. The fair association there, was not allowed to pay the expenses of the exhibit but did give us a premium of $75 which took care of all expenses. The alumnae club of Memphis had charge of the exhibit there (which was the fourth we have had) and bore all expenses. At both places a loom was used to demonstrate. At last we have a tag to mark all Arrowcraft products and one which everyone will like. I feel sure the clubs will welcome these. The price list was revised in the summer and this, with a letter of explanation and a club, or wholesale price list, was sent to each club in the fall. The circulars given to us by Mr. Rogers, of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, have been a world of help as hardly any-one comes into the Shop that doesn't want something that tells about the school. While the gross amount shipped isn't so much greater this year than last there has been less returned for credit. This is a result of smaller orders to more clubs. To date the gross sales have been REPORTS OF OFFICERS 87 $26,201.55 returned for credit $5,981.18. Net business $20,220.37. To ninety-eight people bringing things to the Shop we have paid $22,374.53, an average of $228.31 to each person. Taking the fifty weavers out and the $6,711.59 paid them, it leaves forty-eight basket makers, broom tyers, furniture makers, hookers, tufters and quilters receiving a total of $15,662.94. Everything recommended last year has been carried out with the exception of the water and toilet facilities in the Shop. With so many other improvements being made there never seemed to be a time when the necessary labor was available. We expect to get this done during the summer. There is only one recommendation I feel should be made this year. That is for a Shop in the new Mountain View Hotel which is to be erected this coming winter. I have talked to Mr. Huff about it and he says there is a space in the hotel for such a shop as we would want and that as long as the school is here and wants the space no one else shall have it. I feel sure the space can be leased for a nominal sum. We know that we are not getting our share of the tourist trade and this shop may be a possible solution. There are pros and cons that will need to be carefully discussed at committee meeting. Respectfully submitted, LADELLE ALLEN WEAVING REPORT Another year has come and gone and it is time once more for an annual report. This year I feel as if somethingdefinite has been accomplished among the women of the community. It is hard to put into words, as it is more a feeling of satisfaction that the educational goal that I have been striving toward for four years is in sight at last, than it is a condition that can be seen or expressed in so many sentences. It may be due in part to knowing the women more thoroughly, realizing the shortcomings of each woman and so knowing just how to handle the individual cases in order to give everyone the weaving help best suited to make her happy and satisfied. This only comes from long acquaintance and congenial workers. Working conditions are ideal now and have helped wonderfully to make the work run smoothly. The office, supply room, and large weaving room are in constant use. Sup-plies can be kept in better condition and more easily handled, saving much time. The office makes a convenient and necessary place for the women to bring in their weaving, and get material and receive directions for their weekly weaving. The class room is used the year around: for classes during the school year; several women use the warping bars and it gives a place where the women of the en-tire community can gather for group instruction, a most necessary part of the work, and until this year not available because of lack of space. I have found that the women respond enthusiastically to group instruction and the few meetings we have been able to hold have made the women much more independent in a technical way. They are gradually becoming more expert in the mechanics of weaving due to the rigid campaign held throughout THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI ar for looms in perfect work--Eder and the emphasis put on trly stages of warping, beamnd threading.

This [ am giving the weaving only. From June 1, 1928, to May 17, 1929, we have bought from the women $6,711.59 worth of weaving. More women have their own warping bars so only fifty-nine warps have been made on the school bars. Between September 18, 1928, and December 15, 1928, and February 11, 1929, and May 17, 1929, there have been 621 calls on weaving business only and I have made 117 calls in the homes. The school class was successful. Alice McCarter taught the class practical weaving and I gave the notebook work. There were seven in the class, seventh and eighth grade girls. They paid for the materials they used by weaving towels and selling them to the school. Alice helped me in many other ways and proved to be a valuable assistant. I have tried to spread out the weaving among more families by limiting each home to one loom and keeping the weaving in Gatlinburg and vicinity. There are four young girls weaving this summer to earn money to go to high school next fall, making a total of fifty weavers this year. From my experience I believe that to supervise fifty women and to visit fifty homes located in various degrees of distance and accessibility is all that one person can do successfully. The work seems to be at a good place to pass on to someone else. There have been the usual amount of trials and tribulations, jealousy among the weavers, etc., but I have enjoyed my work here to the utmost and I regret that I have to give it up.

        THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI HEALTH n June to November of the gar we were without a nurse at for the splendid work of ;istant, Lillie Reagan, in keep-Health Center open, being when the doctors and dentist Leir clinic days and looking he simple dressings for the children, I scarcely know ve would have done. Tovember Frances Moore, of .t, Indiana, who had been in -:,ounty Hospital, Chicago, for ars, came to us with a splenreparation and experience. :ply our family but the local seemed to know that we had nurse once again and she and y were soon traveling over gill and up every hollow withossible distance. We have a aighway on which cars can but we also have many trails [d people living on these are es to make an effort to keep :h with. Frances loves it all doing splendid work. ze doctors, one from Sevier-me from Pigeon Forge, and om a nearby community, each me afternoon a week at the i Center for consultation and .ent. A dentist comes out Knoxville one Saturday each . There has been one tonsil with eleven operations. Our health physician holds clinics .rious inoculations and assists he school program our nurse :o carry out in this district. :ounty health unit has set a sk for itself that of sanita-'or entire county. The )f seeing that every home, , and church has a sanitary is a sufficient piece of work to keep two men busy for months to come. Yet sanitation is the thing needed and I believe that a reason-able amount of cooperation will come from the people. The additional appropriation from the county court is providing men for this extra work. Our nurse now has a car, the state paying the upkeep of it. While a car will not take the place of a horse it many times saves a great deal of time and hard riding and with so many better roads seems a necessity. It also is a great convenience in taking patients to Knoxville for examination and treatment as the school truck is not always available nor very comfortable for trips of that kind. Six first year high school girls took the course in home nursing and care of the sick and received state certificates. During the summer Frances has organized two Little Mothers classes. These meet two afternoons each week and undoubtedly are the cutest things you ever saw. She gives the children instruction in how to care for their baby brothers and sisters and it is a course that some of the older ones might be proud to take. Two high school girls who had taken the home hygiene and care of the sick course assisted at the last tonsil clinic and demonstrated that their study had not been spent in vain. Two children were taken to the Trachoma Hospital for treatment and several others were given examinations. A Knoxville specialist gave two days for examining eyes and fitting glasses, saving us many hard trips to Knoxville with children. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 83 COMMUNITY It often seems that we do very little in real community work, yet we probably touch the people much more than we realize. Our crying need these days is a real social worker, one who can give Saturdays and Sundays to the young people who spend their time in the Burg with nothing to do. Library and reading room should be kept open. Books and magazines are here but no one with time enough to devote to keeping playrooms and reading rooms open. During the winter the auditorium was used by the community basket-ball team, Mr. Overton giving much of his time to their practice and games. There have been movies two nights each week since the first of May and they will continue through the summer. This year Arlie Watson and Ernest Reagan are the managers. It is difficult to always get the kind of films we want but on the whole the pictures are fairly good. Old Timers Day is one of the great events of the year, bringing many families in for a real get-together day. The Gatlinburg Fair continues to be the big day of the year. Between 500 and 600 school pupils from Gatlinburg and nearby communities join in the school parade and take part in athletic events during the day. The exhibits are of a high grade and truly "a good time is had by all." We believe it would be worth while to hold it two days in-stead of one. Our Christmas entertainment and tree, the plays during the school year always bring a house full of attentive people. It is our plan tohave more in the line of entertainment and educational addresses now that we have an auditorium. The university and state departments are always more than willing to be of help. Several teachers have had Sunday School classes and usually some at-tend the preaching services which now come twice a month instead of only once. The country church never does develop as fast as school and business do, unfortunately, yet there is a wonderful field waiting for someone to work in. Even though good roads and cars make it very easy for us and for the people here to take their recreation elsewhere we all feel that there is a great need for the home and community social life. EMMA HARPER TURNER CENTER SUGARLANDS The extension school and community work at Sugarlands continues to be one of our most interesting pieces of work. Emily Burton joined the Sugar-lands staff, after ten years in the Gatlinburg school. Eva Hathaway returned for her second year there. Mrs. Dowell left the Burg and be-came housemother and community worker in Sugarlands. These made a fine team. The two girls had the school work, and of course much community work too. Mrs. Dowell took care of the home, taught cooking and sewing, and helped with different outside things. In the winter Mrs. Dowell spent a week at the University of Tennessee for the farm women's short course and came back with plenty of ideas to work out with the local women. One was the making of rugs, hooked and braided. THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI e enrollment the past year in chool has been about eighty. ounty pays the salary in full of teacher, keeps up the necessary rs of the school building and ies the fuel. We pay the salnd living expenses of the third er.

With cutting briars and making gar-and women at work on rugs was much to look after. e year has been a splendid one with all three returning in the xe can look forward to a still better one next year. The work in a small center is mighty interesting. You have your own home life with a small family, you come close to the people around you and it seems as though you can see more being accomplished from day to day than in a larger center. Perhaps we in Gatlinburg sometimes are a little envious. PERMANENT IMPROVEMENTS AND REPAIRS 1928-29 Stuart Cottage : reroof, laundry improved and heated, new water heater and tank installed, coal storage made. New kitchen built at Pollard Cottage ; second story being used for dormitory room. New kitchen equipment purchased. Power house built. Central heating plant installed and two school buildings put on that system. Lights and water system installed in new building. Necessary furnishings purchased for the new building. Rock walks laid at hospital and dormitories. Grading done around new building and other places. Lane at entrance of grounds tiled and filled and road filled and re-graded from entrance to new building. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 1929-30 New septic tank and sewage lines for Pollard and Stuart Cottages. Teachers Cottage repaired and painted. Lavatory installed at Arrowcraft Shop. New floors laid in Stuart Cottage. The building and improvement program of the past two years has been a heavy one but it is pra.eti.. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 85 cally accomplished. It will take careful planning for another two years to get it all paid for and into anything like an easy financial condition but it will come and in the meantime we know that there will be the best possible response from clubs and chapters and we in turn will be as careful as possible of the expenditures here. Our school has never had many large gifts from individuals and even a building pro-gram is carried on largely from the regular donations of the year which make up the budget. No extra drives for funds have been made and it is a real accomplishment to have the new building as nearly paid for as it is under these circumstances. During the winter the treasury was in a most pitiful condition and it was necessary to give a cry of distress. It surely was answered and month by month funds have come in to keep us going but it continues to be a hard struggle for the treasurer. All are glad that this year is behind us and we can start on a new one. .A big task brings a challenge that no doubt is good for us all. Again I want to express my appreciation of the help that has come from officers, clubs, and chapters and for the splendid cooperation of each one on the staff. Each letter, each visit, and each check has helped more than you can realize. Respectfully submitted, EvELYN BISHOP ARROWCRAFT REPORT So much attention has been given in the past few years to the finding for and marketing of the Arrow-craft products that very little atten-tion has been given to those who make the products especially the furniture and basket makers. This past year things have been so organized that we have known bet-ter what we wanted the people to make. The clubs are becoming more familiar with the products and know better what they can and can-not sell. Their orders have come in earlier and they have been free in saying what they felt were best sellers. With every order there has been much correspondence which we feel sure has resulted in better understanding between the clubs and the shop and has been of in-valuable help in timely final settlements. By appealing to the people's pride we have been able to bring up the standards of the baskets. They are beginning to realize they are only hurting themselves when they make a poor basket. When.two or three arrive at the same time you can always hear them criticising one another's baskets bragging on the good points at times but more often pointing out the bad ones. In this way I feel they have helped one another more than we could ever have, regardless of how much we might have talked and scolded. I believe that Mr. Mattil's shop has done more to bring up the standard of the furniture than any-thing ever has or ever could have done. For over two years I talked seasoned wood, sand paper, and, a lot of care in making but I didn't get very far. After Mr. Mattil started his shop I had some things finished to use as samples. The furniture makers seemed amazed to think the things they made "just old common settin' chairs" could be made to look so pretty. One comment THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI : "I 'low that's pretty enough t in anybody's house." It Lied that they always had the that furniture was just rough f that didn't matter much and re wasn't any need in spending t of time on it. One of the best :ers seemed very interested in ing out how it was done, spend-an entire morning asking ques-.s. My curiosity was aroused so ;ked him what he was planning .o. Then he told me he was maksome black walnut chairs for [self and was going to finish n. I felt then that something really been accomplished. Just long we will be able to get the kets and chairs no one knows as 1y of the people have sold out the Park and of course that ins they can no longer cut the )d. here is just one woman and her ghter that do the tufting on the [I mats and bed spreads. She ught her first things to the Shop rly two years ago and they were ful attempts. She appealed to s's sympathy and by encouraging [ suggestions as to colors, etc., we re been able to help her until now one could ask for lovelier things n those she brings in. Ve have had our first quilts this r and have been very fortunate vetting them. Instead of starting h an inexperienced person we re begun with a master quilter. s. Hatcher and her mother-in-., from Wears Valley, do the Ming and I have never seen love-. We have only the full bed size its but hope to eventually work aby crib covers, comforts, etc. hrough Mrs. Dowell's effort we .e had a few hooked mats from Sugarlands. However, we hope to concentrate on braided rugs there and leave the hooking to the women who have been doing it for so long. We have never had any braided rugs but feel there is a market for them. The buying requires more time than it once did, for in these busy days we do not have the opportunity for home visiting and our greatest contact comes through the Shop visiting. This year we have had two exhibits at fairs one at the East Tennessee Division State Fair and one at the Tri-State Fair at Memphis. It was the first exhibit we had had at Knoxville of our industrial products. The fair association there, was not allowed to pay the expenses of the exhibit but did give us a premium of $75 which took care of all expenses. The alumnae club of Memphis had charge of the exhibit there (which was the fourth we have had) and bore all expenses. At both places a loom was used to demonstrate. At last we have a tag to mark all Arrowcraft products and one which everyone will like. I feel sure the clubs will welcome these. The price list was revised in the summer and this, with a letter of explanation and a club, or wholesale price list, was sent to each club in the fall. The circulars given to us by Mr. Rogers, of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, have been a world of help as hardly any-one comes into the Shop that doesn't want something that tells about the school. While the gross amount shipped isn't so much greater this year than last there has been less returned for credit. This is a result of smaller orders to more clubs. To date the gross sales have been REPORTS OF OFFICERS 87 $26,201.55 returned for credit $5,981.18. Net business $20,220.37. To ninety-eight people bringing things to the Shop we have paid $22,374.53, an average of $228.31 to each person. Taking the fifty weavers out and the $6,711.59 paid them, it leaves forty-eight basket makers, broom tyers, furniture makers, hookers, tufters and quilters receiving a total of $15,662.94. Everything recommended last year has been carried out with the exception of the water and toilet facilities in the Shop. With so many other improvements being made there never seemed to be a time when the necessary labor was available. We expect to get this done during the summer. There is only one recommendation I feel should be made this year. That is for a Shop in the new Mountain View Hotel which is to be erected this coming winter. I have talked to Mr. Huff about it and he says there is a space in the hotel for such a shop as we would want and that as long as the school is here and wants the space no one else shall have it. I feel sure the space can be leased for a nominal sum. We know that we are not getting our share of the tourist trade and this shop may be a possible solution. There are pros and cons that will need to be carefully discussed at committee meeting. Respectfully submitted, LADELLE ALLEN WEAVING REPORT Another year has come and gone and it is time once more for an annual report. This year I feel as if somethingdefinite has been accomplished among the women of the community. It is hard to put into words, as it is more a feeling of satisfaction that the educational goal that I have been striving toward for four years is in sight at last, than it is a condition that can be seen or expressed in so many sentences. It may be due in part to knowing the women more thoroughly, realizing the shortcomings of each woman and so knowing just how to handle the individual cases in order to give everyone the weaving help best suited to make her happy and satisfied. This only comes from long acquaintance and congenial workers. Working conditions are ideal now and have helped wonderfully to make the work run smoothly. The office, supply room, and large weaving room are in constant use. Sup-plies can be kept in better condition and more easily handled, saving much time. The office makes a convenient and necessary place for the women to bring in their weaving, and get material and receive directions for their weekly weaving. The class room is used the year around: for classes during the school year; several women use the warping bars and it gives a place where the women of the en-tire community can gather for group instruction, a most necessary part of the work, and until this year not available because of lack of space. I have found that the women respond enthusiastically to group instruction and the few meetings we have been able to hold have made the women much more independent in a technical way. They are gradually becoming more expert in the mechanics of weaving due to the rigid campaign held throughout THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI ar for looms in perfect work--Eder and the emphasis put on trly stages of warping, beamnd threading.

This [ am giving the weaving only. From June 1, 1928, to May 17, 1929, we have bought from the women $6,711.59 worth of weaving. More women have their own warping bars so only fifty-nine warps have been made on the school bars. Between September 18, 1928, and December 15, 1928, and February 11, 1929, and May 17, 1929, there have been 621 calls on weaving business only and I have made 117 calls in the homes. The school class was successful. Alice McCarter taught the class practical weaving and I gave the notebook work. There were seven in the class, seventh and eighth grade girls. They paid for the materials they used by weaving towels and selling them to the school. Alice helped me in many other ways and proved to be a valuable assistant. I have tried to spread out the weaving among more families by limiting each home to one loom and keeping the weaving in Gatlinburg and vicinity. There are four young girls weaving this summer to earn money to go to high school next fall, making a total of fifty weavers this year. From my experience I believe that to supervise fifty women and to visit fifty homes located in various degrees of distance and accessibility is all that one person can do successfully. The work seems to be at a good place to pass on to someone else. There have been the usual amount of trials and tribulations, jealousy among the weavers, etc., but I have enjoyed my work here to the utmost and I regret that I have to give it up. Respectfully submitted, WINOGENE B. REDDING REPORTS OF OFFICERS Report of Treasurer of Settlement School 89 We herewith respectfully submit our report on the audit and examination of the records and accounts received from you as treasurer and from Miss Elizabeth Cooke, book-keeper of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, located at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, for a period of thirteen months, beginning May 31, 1928, and ending June 30, 1929.

It a hard day but a profitable one satisfactory even though they the Sunday School teachers, horister, Sunday School super-dent, and possibly sometimes reacher. During the summer :ion the people have determined tg themselves that they will nue the Sunday School. .s.

With cutting briars and making gar-and women at work on rugs was much to look after. e year has been a splendid one with all three returning in the xe can look forward to a still better one next year. The work in a small center is mighty interesting. You have your own home life with a small family, you come close to the people around you and it seems as though you can see more being accomplished from day to day than in a larger center. Perhaps we in Gatlinburg sometimes are a little envious. PERMANENT IMPROVEMENTS AND REPAIRS 1928-29 Stuart Cottage : reroof, laundry improved and heated, new water heater and tank installed, coal storage made. New kitchen built at Pollard Cottage ; second story being used for dormitory room. New kitchen equipment purchased. Power house built. Central heating plant installed and two school buildings put on that system. Lights and water system installed in new building. Necessary furnishings purchased for the new building. Rock walks laid at hospital and dormitories. Grading done around new building and other places. Lane at entrance of grounds tiled and filled and road filled and re-graded from entrance to new building. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 1929-30 New septic tank and sewage lines for Pollard and Stuart Cottages. Teachers Cottage repaired and painted. Lavatory installed at Arrowcraft Shop. New floors laid in Stuart Cottage. The building and improvement program of the past two years has been a heavy one but it is pra.eti.. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 85 cally accomplished. It will take careful planning for another two years to get it all paid for and into anything like an easy financial condition but it will come and in the meantime we know that there will be the best possible response from clubs and chapters and we in turn will be as careful as possible of the expenditures here. Our school has never had many large gifts from individuals and even a building pro-gram is carried on largely from the regular donations of the year which make up the budget. No extra drives for funds have been made and it is a real accomplishment to have the new building as nearly paid for as it is under these circumstances. During the winter the treasury was in a most pitiful condition and it was necessary to give a cry of distress. It surely was answered and month by month funds have come in to keep us going but it continues to be a hard struggle for the treasurer. All are glad that this year is behind us and we can start on a new one. .A big task brings a challenge that no doubt is good for us all. Again I want to express my appreciation of the help that has come from officers, clubs, and chapters and for the splendid cooperation of each one on the staff. Each letter, each visit, and each check has helped more than you can realize. Respectfully submitted, EvELYN BISHOP ARROWCRAFT REPORT So much attention has been given in the past few years to the finding for and marketing of the Arrow-craft products that very little atten-tion has been given to those who make the products especially the furniture and basket makers. This past year things have been so organized that we have known bet-ter what we wanted the people to make. The clubs are becoming more familiar with the products and know better what they can and can-not sell. Their orders have come in earlier and they have been free in saying what they felt were best sellers. With every order there has been much correspondence which we feel sure has resulted in better understanding between the clubs and the shop and has been of in-valuable help in timely final settlements. By appealing to the people's pride we have been able to bring up the standards of the baskets. They are beginning to realize they are only hurting themselves when they make a poor basket. When.two or three arrive at the same time you can always hear them criticising one another's baskets bragging on the good points at times but more often pointing out the bad ones. In this way I feel they have helped one another more than we could ever have, regardless of how much we might have talked and scolded. I believe that Mr. Mattil's shop has done more to bring up the standard of the furniture than any-thing ever has or ever could have done. For over two years I talked seasoned wood, sand paper, and, a lot of care in making but I didn't get very far. After Mr. Mattil started his shop I had some things finished to use as samples. The furniture makers seemed amazed to think the things they made "just old common settin' chairs" could be made to look so pretty. One comment THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI : "I 'low that's pretty enough t in anybody's house." It Lied that they always had the that furniture was just rough f that didn't matter much and re wasn't any need in spending t of time on it. One of the best :ers seemed very interested in ing out how it was done, spend-an entire morning asking ques-.s. My curiosity was aroused so ;ked him what he was planning .o. Then he told me he was maksome black walnut chairs for [self and was going to finish n. I felt then that something really been accomplished. Just long we will be able to get the kets and chairs no one knows as 1y of the people have sold out the Park and of course that ins they can no longer cut the )d. here is just one woman and her ghter that do the tufting on the [I mats and bed spreads. She ught her first things to the Shop rly two years ago and they were ful attempts. She appealed to s's sympathy and by encouraging [ suggestions as to colors, etc., we re been able to help her until now one could ask for lovelier things n those she brings in. Ve have had our first quilts this r and have been very fortunate vetting them. Instead of starting h an inexperienced person we re begun with a master quilter. s. Hatcher and her mother-in-., from Wears Valley, do the Ming and I have never seen love-. We have only the full bed size its but hope to eventually work aby crib covers, comforts, etc. hrough Mrs. Dowell's effort we .e had a few hooked mats from Sugarlands. However, we hope to concentrate on braided rugs there and leave the hooking to the women who have been doing it for so long. We have never had any braided rugs but feel there is a market for them. The buying requires more time than it once did, for in these busy days we do not have the opportunity for home visiting and our greatest contact comes through the Shop visiting. This year we have had two exhibits at fairs one at the East Tennessee Division State Fair and one at the Tri-State Fair at Memphis. It was the first exhibit we had had at Knoxville of our industrial products. The fair association there, was not allowed to pay the expenses of the exhibit but did give us a premium of $75 which took care of all expenses. The alumnae club of Memphis had charge of the exhibit there (which was the fourth we have had) and bore all expenses. At both places a loom was used to demonstrate. At last we have a tag to mark all Arrowcraft products and one which everyone will like. I feel sure the clubs will welcome these. The price list was revised in the summer and this, with a letter of explanation and a club, or wholesale price list, was sent to each club in the fall. The circulars given to us by Mr. Rogers, of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, have been a world of help as hardly any-one comes into the Shop that doesn't want something that tells about the school. While the gross amount shipped isn't so much greater this year than last there has been less returned for credit. This is a result of smaller orders to more clubs. To date the gross sales have been REPORTS OF OFFICERS 87 $26,201.55 returned for credit $5,981.18. Net business $20,220.37. To ninety-eight people bringing things to the Shop we have paid $22,374.53, an average of $228.31 to each person. Taking the fifty weavers out and the $6,711.59 paid them, it leaves forty-eight basket makers, broom tyers, furniture makers, hookers, tufters and quilters receiving a total of $15,662.94. Everything recommended last year has been carried out with the exception of the water and toilet facilities in the Shop. With so many other improvements being made there never seemed to be a time when the necessary labor was available. We expect to get this done during the summer. There is only one recommendation I feel should be made this year. That is for a Shop in the new Mountain View Hotel which is to be erected this coming winter. I have talked to Mr. Huff about it and he says there is a space in the hotel for such a shop as we would want and that as long as the school is here and wants the space no one else shall have it. I feel sure the space can be leased for a nominal sum. We know that we are not getting our share of the tourist trade and this shop may be a possible solution. There are pros and cons that will need to be carefully discussed at committee meeting. Respectfully submitted, LADELLE ALLEN WEAVING REPORT Another year has come and gone and it is time once more for an annual report. This year I feel as if somethingdefinite has been accomplished among the women of the community. It is hard to put into words, as it is more a feeling of satisfaction that the educational goal that I have been striving toward for four years is in sight at last, than it is a condition that can be seen or expressed in so many sentences. It may be due in part to knowing the women more thoroughly, realizing the shortcomings of each woman and so knowing just how to handle the individual cases in order to give everyone the weaving help best suited to make her happy and satisfied. This only comes from long acquaintance and congenial workers. Working conditions are ideal now and have helped wonderfully to make the work run smoothly. The office, supply room, and large weaving room are in constant use. Sup-plies can be kept in better condition and more easily handled, saving much time. The office makes a convenient and necessary place for the women to bring in their weaving, and get material and receive directions for their weekly weaving. The class room is used the year around: for classes during the school year; several women use the warping bars and it gives a place where the women of the en-tire community can gather for group instruction, a most necessary part of the work, and until this year not available because of lack of space. I have found that the women respond enthusiastically to group instruction and the few meetings we have been able to hold have made the women much more independent in a technical way.

Between September 18, 1928, and December 15, 1928, and February 11, 1929, and May 17, 1929, there have been 621 calls on weaving business only and I have made 117 calls in the homes. The school class was successful. Alice McCarter taught the class practical weaving and I gave the notebook work. There were seven in the class, seventh and eighth grade girls. They paid for the materials they used by weaving towels and selling them to the school. Alice helped me in many other ways and proved to be a valuable assistant. I have tried to spread out the weaving among more families by limiting each home to one loom and keeping the weaving in Gatlinburg and vicinity. There are four young girls weaving this summer to earn money to go to high school next fall, making a total of fifty weavers this year. From my experience I believe that to supervise fifty women and to visit fifty homes located in various degrees of distance and accessibility is all that one person can do successfully. The work seems to be at a good place to pass on to someone else. There have been the usual amount of trials and tribulations, jealousy among the weavers, etc., but I have enjoyed my work here to the utmost and I regret that I have to give it up.

        THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI : "I 'low that's pretty enough t in anybody's house." It Lied that they always had the that furniture was just rough f that didn't matter much and re wasn't any need in spending t of time on it. One of the best :ers seemed very interested in ing out how it was done, spend-an entire morning asking ques-.s. My curiosity was aroused so ;ked him what he was planning .o. Then he told me he was maksome black walnut chairs for [self and was going to finish n. I felt then that something really been accomplished. Just long we will be able to get the kets and chairs no one knows as 1y of the people have sold out the Park and of course that ins they can no longer cut the )d. here is just one woman and her ghter that do the tufting on the [I mats and bed spreads. She ught her first things to the Shop rly two years ago and they were ful attempts. She appealed to s's sympathy and by encouraging [ suggestions as to colors, etc., we re been able to help her until now one could ask for lovelier things n those she brings in. Ve have had our first quilts this r and have been very fortunate vetting them. Instead of starting h an inexperienced person we re begun with a master quilter. s. Hatcher and her mother-in-., from Wears Valley, do the Ming and I have never seen love-. We have only the full bed size its but hope to eventually work aby crib covers, comforts, etc. hrough Mrs. Dowell's effort we .e had a few hooked mats from Sugarlands. However, we hope to concentrate on braided rugs there and leave the hooking to the women who have been doing it for so long. We have never had any braided rugs but feel there is a market for them. The buying requires more time than it once did, for in these busy days we do not have the opportunity for home visiting and our greatest contact comes through the Shop visiting. This year we have had two exhibits at fairs one at the East Tennessee Division State Fair and one at the Tri-State Fair at Memphis. It was the first exhibit we had had at Knoxville of our industrial products. The fair association there, was not allowed to pay the expenses of the exhibit but did give us a premium of $75 which took care of all expenses. The alumnae club of Memphis had charge of the exhibit there (which was the fourth we have had) and bore all expenses. At both places a loom was used to demonstrate. At last we have a tag to mark all Arrowcraft products and one which everyone will like. I feel sure the clubs will welcome these. The price list was revised in the summer and this, with a letter of explanation and a club, or wholesale price list, was sent to each club in the fall. The circulars given to us by Mr. Rogers, of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, have been a world of help as hardly any-one comes into the Shop that doesn't want something that tells about the school. While the gross amount shipped isn't so much greater this year than last there has been less returned for credit. This is a result of smaller orders to more clubs. To date the gross sales have been REPORTS OF OFFICERS 87 $26,201.55 returned for credit $5,981.18. Net business $20,220.37. To ninety-eight people bringing things to the Shop we have paid $22,374.53, an average of $228.31 to each person. Taking the fifty weavers out and the $6,711.59 paid them, it leaves forty-eight basket makers, broom tyers, furniture makers, hookers, tufters and quilters receiving a total of $15,662.94. Everything recommended last year has been carried out with the exception of the water and toilet facilities in the Shop. With so many other improvements being made there never seemed to be a time when the necessary labor was available. We expect to get this done during the summer. There is only one recommendation I feel should be made this year. That is for a Shop in the new Mountain View Hotel which is to be erected this coming winter. I have talked to Mr. Huff about it and he says there is a space in the hotel for such a shop as we would want and that as long as the school is here and wants the space no one else shall have it. I feel sure the space can be leased for a nominal sum. We know that we are not getting our share of the tourist trade and this shop may be a possible solution. There are pros and cons that will need to be carefully discussed at committee meeting. Respectfully submitted, LADELLE ALLEN WEAVING REPORT Another year has come and gone and it is time once more for an annual report. This year I feel as if somethingdefinite has been accomplished among the women of the community. It is hard to put into words, as it is more a feeling of satisfaction that the educational goal that I have been striving toward for four years is in sight at last, than it is a condition that can be seen or expressed in so many sentences. It may be due in part to knowing the women more thoroughly, realizing the shortcomings of each woman and so knowing just how to handle the individual cases in order to give everyone the weaving help best suited to make her happy and satisfied. This only comes from long acquaintance and congenial workers. Working conditions are ideal now and have helped wonderfully to make the work run smoothly. The office, supply room, and large weaving room are in constant use. Sup-plies can be kept in better condition and more easily handled, saving much time. The office makes a convenient and necessary place for the women to bring in their weaving, and get material and receive directions for their weekly weaving. The class room is used the year around: for classes during the school year; several women use the warping bars and it gives a place where the women of the en-tire community can gather for group instruction, a most necessary part of the work, and until this year not available because of lack of space. I have found that the women respond enthusiastically to group instruction and the few meetings we have been able to hold have made the women much more independent in a technical way. They are gradually becoming more expert in the mechanics of weaving due to the rigid campaign held throughout THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI ar for looms in perfect work--Eder and the emphasis put on trly stages of warping, beamnd threading. They can take ions about draft and pattern in an intelligent manner. ction of detail and a high a.rd of every part of the work axing a great deal to do with jlendicl grade of weaving the n bring to us. individual work done during revious years has prepared omen for this group instructs it laid a foundation which 5 it possible to absorb knowlin large portions.

This [ am giving the weaving only. From June 1, 1928, to May 17, 1929, we have bought from the women $6,711.59 worth of weaving. More women have their own warping bars so only fifty-nine warps have been made on the school bars. Between September 18, 1928, and December 15, 1928, and February 11, 1929, and May 17, 1929, there have been 621 calls on weaving business only and I have made 117 calls in the homes. The school class was successful. Alice McCarter taught the class practical weaving and I gave the notebook work. There were seven in the class, seventh and eighth grade girls. They paid for the materials they used by weaving towels and selling them to the school. Alice helped me in many other ways and proved to be a valuable assistant. I have tried to spread out the weaving among more families by limiting each home to one loom and keeping the weaving in Gatlinburg and vicinity. There are four young girls weaving this summer to earn money to go to high school next fall, making a total of fifty weavers this year. From my experience I believe that to supervise fifty women and to visit fifty homes located in various degrees of distance and accessibility is all that one person can do successfully. The work seems to be at a good place to pass on to someone else. There have been the usual amount of trials and tribulations, jealousy among the weavers, etc., but I have enjoyed my work here to the utmost and I regret that I have to give it up.

There are women weaving at the presme than a year ago so by Sep-a1 we plan to have more ng on hand than we had last which is most necessary as our y of weaving was low. and A over by the middle of Octo-We now start our Christmas ing in January and encourage women to weave steadily ghout the summer instead of hg during those months and rig in the fall. my report a year ago hooked quilts, and tufted work were led with the weaving. This [ am giving the weaving only. From June 1, 1928, to May 17, 1929, we have bought from the women $6,711.59 worth of weaving. More women have their own warping bars so only fifty-nine warps have been made on the school bars. Between September 18, 1928, and December 15, 1928, and February 11, 1929, and May 17, 1929, there have been 621 calls on weaving business only and I have made 117 calls in the homes. The school class was successful. Alice McCarter taught the class practical weaving and I gave the notebook work. There were seven in the class, seventh and eighth grade girls. They paid for the materials they used by weaving towels and selling them to the school. Alice helped me in many other ways and proved to be a valuable assistant. I have tried to spread out the weaving among more families by limiting each home to one loom and keeping the weaving in Gatlinburg and vicinity. There are four young girls weaving this summer to earn money to go to high school next fall, making a total of fifty weavers this year. From my experience I believe that to supervise fifty women and to visit fifty homes located in various degrees of distance and accessibility is all that one person can do successfully. The work seems to be at a good place to pass on to someone else. There have been the usual amount of trials and tribulations, jealousy among the weavers, etc., but I have enjoyed my work here to the utmost and I regret that I have to give it up.

CURRYER, Treasurer 68 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI notes, in compliance with our suggestions. Some make no answer to repeated inquiries, and take no steps toward collection. We consider this one of the most important financial weaknesses of the chapters which remains to be overcome. Since the girls do not fully realize the importance of this matter, and this office can only ad-vise, we wonder what would be the general reaction if Grand Council should devise some plan by which the supervisor would report to the Grand President chapters carrying the same delinquents for more than one month, with the idea that the chapters would be fined by Grand Council just as they are fined for not sending in reports on time. This office is planning to get out a letter to each chapter president in September, asking her cooperation in reducing the delinquent list, and suggesting ways and means as used in other chapters for eliminating this evil. Again may we bring to your attention the disadvantage of special assessments. As the main value of a budget is to predetermine the house bill and the chapter expenses, collecting special assessments from members entirely defeats the purpose. In a great many cases it has been demonstrated that the yearly change in treasurers has been responsible for temporary mis-use of the Busey System. We strongly recommend that whenever possible the same treasurer hold office for two years, and that the out-going treasurer take pains to instruct the new treasurer in her duties thoroughly. The new treasurer should always be chosen from girls who are confident of returning the fol-lowing September, and should be selected for her ability and not for her popularity or her need of the financial assistance. The National Supervisor feels that an overwhelming per cent of the chapters are using the Busey System successfully now, and that the difficulty in some few chapters is due to the fact that they are not using the whole system wholeheartedly. Most chapters have shown an increasing prosperity and stability during the year, and have given this office splendid cooperation in every detail.

Respectfully submitte DOROTHY BURROWS MARIE FREEMAN PA Report of Chairman of Settlement School Comnh The year of 1928-29 for the school has been decidedly one of marking time, and while there has been the improvement dictated by experience along many lines, there has also been an absence of outstanding events characteristic of any con-tented routine life. So far the radical changes anticipated from the establishment of the Smoky Mountain National Park have materialized only in a rather widespread selling of property and exodus of people from the vicinity of the Sugarlands and the steady increase of tourists. The constant growth in the last few years in the number of pupils, the amount of detail work to be done in managing so large an establishment, and the great number of visitors to the school are bringing us face to face with the vital need for additions to the staff. It is difficult to say which we need most. With the building, repairing, and remodeling of old buildings, the road making and upkeep in our owngrounds, the minor plumb: electrical installations, the vision of student labor, overseeing of the farm, wl all constantly necessary, finding it almost imperative a man to manage that phas( work. Mr. Mattil has he. assumed the major part of dition to his teaching and detriment of his health, bu full-time job in itself and fair to ask a teacher to uncle In the school itself the lar rollment, from fifty to sev( pils, is concentrated in the first, and second grades un teacher, and that task sh lightened by adding a teacher to the staff.

Overton and the Sugar-:aff have pursued the same .t course of instruction as Lr. Every teacher has her rtificate so we are assured ler rating. Miss Kibler is academic teacher who will .ern to us and we lose her ret. The plan at the Sugar-E having two teachers and a housekeeper who does a great deal of community work has proved very satisfactory. Among the special teachers we are sorry to report several resignations, each of them an extremely difficult place to fill. No other one person could do for us all that Mr. Mattil has done in his eight years at the school, and we owe him an enormous debt of gratitude not only for the work he has accomplished but for his unfailing interest and loyalty. Miss Redding's work is probably more widely known to the fraternity in general than that of any other teacher, for it is she who de-signs the lovely and original things sent out from the Arrowcraft Shop each year and who has so painstakingly instructed the mountain people in order to produce articles of such a high degree of artistic and technical excellence. She has trained so thoroughly some of her apter pupils, and too, Miss Allen, who runs the Shop, has worked so closely and sympathetically with her that there will be no diminution from the high standards she has set, but her position is a hard one to fill and we shall miss her keenly. The work of Mrs. Farmer, the home economics teacher, is not so widely known, but it has had a strong influence in the community itself. One outstanding example of her ability was the remodeling and furnishing under her supervision and from materials at hand of a mountain cabin which won second prize in a national better homes competition. The writeup and pictures of this in THE ARROW have given you some idea of the splendid influence such work has in the community and how much of a loss her REPORTS OF OFFICERS 71 resignation means to us. Mrs. Farmer represents a truly Panhellenic spirit, for she is a Chi Omega and we have never had a teacher more devoted to the interests of the school. The health center was handicapped for several months by not having a nurse, but since November the position has been ably filled by Frances Moore, and the plans undertaken by the county for next year give promise of better results than ever before. During the frequent periods in the last three years when we have been without a nurse, Lillie Reagan, a Gatlinburg girl who assists at the health center, has tided over the intervals by helping the doctors who held clinics and doing some nursing, and to her we owe the fact that this valuable work has not been al-lowed to lapse over long periods but has been kept in such good condition that a new nurse could quickly pick up the threads without having to waste time in reorganization. This training of latent, native ability is one of the most vital results of our work at Gatlinburg and we are proud of every example of it which comes back like bread cast upon the waters. There are many who have gone out to other schools and communities, many who raise the standard of living conditions in Gatlinburg, and in the school itself, beside Lillie Reagan are Cora Mc-Carter, who until last year taught in the Sugarlands, Otha Reagan who supervises the student labor, and Arlie Watson who has substituted during Otha's long illness this spring, Ernest Reagan, who does all the odd jobs of repairing, electric lighting, etc., Alice McCarter, who has taught weaving in the school, Veatress Parton, who has helped in the Arrowcraft Shop; the three or four girls who have cooked at different times; and the dormitory girls and boys who do much of the work about the house and farm. Miss Bishop has as always con-ducted the many problems of ad-ministration with the tact and wisdom which endear her to everyone with whom she has contact and make her service to the fraternity of incalculable value. Her report will give you all the interesting de-tails which this summary lacks. Work with the committee this year has been an inspiration and pleasure and I sincerely regret that the completion of my four year term brings that close association to an end. The service of Edith Gordon and Blanche Curtis to the fraternity in other fields is already so well known, that I need not tell you how invaluable has been their work for the school, nor with what confidence and satisfaction I turn over the du-ties of chairman to Dr. Gordon. Ethel Curryer's efficient work as treasurer is familiar to you all and the success of financing our heavy building program for the last two years is due to her skillful management. Marguerite Ellis last fall provided the slides and films with new containers and has supervised their journeys to Alpha, Delta, and Kappa provinces. She has managed a trying job splendidly. Dr. Gordon reports that letters were sent to isolated alumme in an effort to have them join the national alumnae organization and to interest them in work for the school, but as the replies were sent to the province vice presidents, the response is not yet correlated. Mrs. Curtis has pre-pared the Little Pigeon articles for THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI BROW and sent a letter of to each club and chapter for :-ibution. Through these let-m the committee, the month-, and Gatlinburg News from ool, and frequent bulletins Le Arrowcraft Shop, a close aication with many members fraternity has been main constructive help and pleas-tact with Grand Council and 1 officers has been greatly apd and enjoyed. re again grateful to Mr. Col-r insurance agent, for a sub-gift to the school, and also and Mrs. Rogers of Mt. It, Iowa, for the gift of five thousand of the leaflets of information which are available at this convention. And for the help, cooperation, and generous contributions from the fraternity at large the committee gives its most grateful thanks. We are particularly glad to note the in-creasing number of contributions which come in around Christmas time, and if every club and chapter could realize what worry it saves the treasurer to have money coming in during the lean months of December, January, and February, when expenditures are very heavy, we are sure the custom would be-come universal. GERTRUDE B. FREEMAN Report of Director of Settlement School 'riting a report of the past am impressed with the fact has been one of completing, as possible, projects already rather than a year of new While this is in many ways story it does lack, the thrill work and the finishing tasks edious and hard when they so many months. structure of the new building Tactically completed by the Le new term started in Aug-: the heating, plumbing, and were yet to be put in. The t task came with the building power house. It had been I that a central heating sys-)uld be put in now, the school gs being put on the same sysonce, and plans laid for add-her cottages to it when it wise. This came after the building program of the ro years, when we were corn-worn out with that kind ofwork and worry. Excavating for the power house brought other problems if the dirt and rock blasted out of that hole, twenty feet by forty feet by eleven feet, was to be used for building up our roads, the lanes must be tiled first. Ditches of appalling depth had to be dug all over the place and it seemed all winter that we never would be cleared up and smoothed over again. By spring things were very nearly graded and seeded down and we felt that we had buried a world of troubles in each of those ditches. The next year should be a much easier one. While it is a regret to bring coal soot and smoke into our lovely mountains we do keep much more comfortable than in the days when even green wood was hard to get. Can it be possible that we now use two carloads of coal, in addition to all the fire and stove wood? Practically the same program has REPORTS OF OFFICERS 73 been followed in every department. No radical changes have occurred anywhere. Yet in some ways it has been one of the most difficult years we have had. No doubt the fact that for the past six months there has not been a single day when every member of the staff has been able to be on duty has called for real effort to keep up the morale. The flu epidemic which came before Christmas and lasted all winter had not released its hold on some of the family when school closed in the spring. In addition to this it has been a year when trying repairs be-came necessary. Difficulties with the water system, unsatisfactory electric current, and other almost daily troubles had to be met. Last year I mentioned the pro-posed Smoky Mountain National Park. At present it seems as though the "land sale" methods used during the winter have stopped and we hope people back in the hollows will not be too hasty in moving away. Our immediate territory has not been seriously affected. Even the Sugarlands has almost as many families still living there, although eventually that section is sure to be in the park boundary. Until the large timber tracts can be purchased the state cannot turn the land over to the government. When this really becomes a park is more than we can say and in the meantime there is no reason why we should not continue calmly on. Already a road through the Sugarlands to the top of the Smoky Mountain range is graded and with-in three or four months will be in condition for cars to go the entire way and it is a most beautiful drive to the North Carolina line. I regret that a list has not beenkept of the visiting Pi Phis for scarcely a day goes by, winter or summer, that one or more do not come. Many stay for a few hours ; some get only to the Arrowcraft Shop; others take time enough to see the whole place and even make a quick trip to Sugarlands (for quick trips there are now possible). We surely enjoy and appreciate these visits and we only hope those coming receive as much pleasure and inspiration as their visits give us. And Washington and Niagara Falls are not the only places sometimes I think Gatlinburg bids fair to be a Pi Phi honeymoon resort. The staff has been: Evelyn Bishop, director. W. B.

SCHOOL n spite of the confusion caused the unfinished building and so ch sickness, we feel we can re-'t a more than usually successful :he total enrollment was 168--:nty-six of that number were in t and second year high school. Vlr. Overton had accomplished much the year previous in seing certificates, rating, etc., for school that the new year started much easier. Every teacher had state certificate at the opening school and there were no doubts )ut the rating with the state de--tment. dr. Overton and Miss Kibler had same classes as the year before, Overton taking all the mathetics for the seventh, eighth, ,th, and tenth grades and Miss )ler all the English. In the fall se classes were held in the new lding but as mornings grew cool y would be one day in the old 1 the next in the new. Finally it s necessary to go back into the quarters and stay there until heating system was completed January. Light pupils completed second Lr high school and all expect to enter some other school in the fall. While only three received eighth grade certificates the first year high school class will probably have the usual number as nearly all those pupils come from nearby schools but far enough away to make it necessary for them to be in the dormitory. Eleanor Brabson, Alice Williams, and Henrietta McCutchan made a splendid team and although they were here for the first time they found no difficulty in quickly adjusting themselves to their new work as they were three very efficient teachers. Alice had the fifth and sixth grades, Henrietta the third and fourth, and Eleanor the primary, first, and second. There is a real criticism that could be made and I hope before long we can consider a change. The three grades, primer, first, and second, have the largest enrollment and are in the same room under the same teacher. The year we had kindergarten work for the youngest ones was most satisfactory and I trust another year it will be possible for a budget allowance to provide again for this work. While the four upper grades have a nine months school term these others have only eight months. Henrietta. McCutchan and Mr. Overton coached the basketball teams and, as many of the pupils had never seen a game before coming here, it meant starting from the beginning. After getting into the new building light practice was made compulsory for all seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth grade boys and girls. The teams entered the East Tennessee high school tournament and although we were the only two year high school entrant our pupils made a very creditable show REPORTS OF OFFICERS ing. Another year both Mr. Over-ton and Miss McCutchan hope to do more along the line of supervised play. The usual plays and social affairs were given during the year and in whatever was done the cooperation was unusually good. We are sorry to have Miss Kibler leave this spring and very glad the other grade teachers will re-turn. All three special teachers are leaving this year, Mr. Mattil, Katherine Farmer, and Winogene Red-ding and the places will be hard to fill. Of the eight pupils completing second year high last year six have been in school this year, one in Newport High, one in Maryville High, three in Sevierville High, and one in Murphy Institute. The other two have been working this year to earn money to enter school next fall. Mrs. Duffield and Mrs. Gilbert, both former music teachers and now living in Gatlinburg, have given mu-sic lessons to quite a number of pupils but there has been no pul)lic school music taught in the school. This is always a regret as there is such a wonderful opportunity to develop this native talent. This year shows a still better reimbursement from the county for maintaining the eight grades of the day school, due to all teachers having state professional certificates. The county has paid us the past year for teachers and fuel $3,318. This does not include any of the state funds allowed us for agriculture, weaving, and home economics. The class work in agriculture, home economics, and weaving is incorporated into the reports of those departments. HoME EcoNomics The usual home economics cla; were held for first and second y high school girls; each class hav two periods every morning. W their work follows the state cot and has the same laboratory textbook work, girls here have m practical experience than usuall possible in a high school.

The evening school prograrr planned a year ago never did terialize. Instead of coming tc in January for full time ever school work, Jean Steele was to Elizabethton. Because of the dustrial situation there large n hers of mountain people had me into the town and presented a for work that only one with ex ence and ability could handle. state department felt that Jean the best one for the place. Katherine Watson devoted p tically all of her time to reg school work home economics science classes. They kept her f having time for evening sc work although she did manag get in one afternoon class each ti and the latter part of the year in one night class. Two intensive sewing c12 were held by Mrs. Zuccarellc the state department, and the di making done during those w was nothing short of ama; THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI ese courses were financed partly the state and partly by those ing the course. The exhibit at Gatlinburg Fair showed what week of sewing had accornshed. The home economics work closed the year at the end of the school m, no community classes being -ried on during the vacation. ks Katherine Watson married we a vacancy to fill at the end of school year. Miss Mary Rachel mstrong, University of Tenneswill take Katherine's place and, less present plans fail, will devote 7 entire time to home economics : cool classes in the morning and nmunity classes in the afternoon. already a full program is being rked out for the new year and we ill be glad to again take up these nmunity classes that we feel are very worth while. SGRICULTURE AND FARM SHOP [n writing a report of this departnt we have to remember that Mr. ittil has had so many different es of work outside of school rou e that we wonder he has been e to accomplish one-half that he n Smith Hughes agriculture !re is a school program that takes morning, each class having two -iods every day. This corre-)nds to the home economics pro-Lm. The afternoons should be en over to community work such junior poultry clubs, spraying pruning of orchards, advising stock and crops, veterinary ad e and treatment, and in fact do-; about everything called for. e shop work is along the line practical farm aid, making wag-beds and wheel barrows, self feeders for chickens and pigs, harness repairing, care of tools, etc. Each boy from the seventh grade up has a home project which he keeps an accurate record of, under the supervision of the teacher. These are varied. Some boys take a pig for a project, some a cow, others have crop projects. Many take poultry. The past two years the building program and other improvements have taken much of Mr. Mattil's time as he has supervised all these. It has been a real regret to him and to us that the educational work in nearby communities where he had had clubs and classes had to be dropped for this but no person could have handled both. In addition to these there is the farm to supervise and the student labor to keep in touch with. After seven years spent in organizing and building up this department Mr. Mattil feels he must give up teaching. We will have a hard task to fill his place, in fact shall not try to find anyone who can shoulder so much. He has done an outstanding piece of work which is recognized and appreciated by all. With the beginning of the new school year we shall go back to a distinct school program in this department, endeavoring to keep the outside things entirely separate from the work that rightfully be-longs to this department. For a year or more Mr. Mattil has been carrying on a very interesting piece of work independent of the school, yet somewhat associated with it too. The demands for antiques were so insistent he finally fitted up the old barn, near the school building, as a shop; putting an electric system and motors, REPORTS OF OFFICERS wood working machinery, etc., and employed from one to five boys to refinish old furniture and reproduce crickets, book shelves, tables, and in fact many different kinds of things which are sold in. the Arrow-craft Shop. The training these boys have had in the shop has been of the best and we only hope that Mr. Mattil has been able to at least come out even financially with the proposition. There is no doubt but that this has had a great influence on the furniture makers of the community for they are now bringing in better furniture than ever before. I am sure that eventually the school will want to take this over but at the present time we are only too glad to have Mr. Mattil want to keep it. FARM AND STUDENT LABOR The report of the farm and of the student labor is most satisfactory. More has been raised in the garden for the table, stock well cared for, fields in better condition, the place showing improvement generally. We are asked many times what we keep on the farm. We have three horses, one for farm work, two for the nurse and teachers. Four cows, one registered heifer gotten this past year, a registered Jersey bull, five Berkshire hogs, Barred Rock poultry, two Shropshire sheep gotten this year. About 100 hens are kept during the win-ter. At present we have nearly 1,000 little chicks, some to keep, most to be sold during the summer for ' fryers. Our incubators and brooders do service for the whole community. The farm and the student laboris all looked after by Otha Rea under the supervision and plann of Mr. Mattil. Otha is a ma: hand with the boys and as he been here a long time he is tl~ oughly familiar with Mr. Mat methods and can take a great of responsibility. Otha has b away because of illness for the five months and the work has b done by a former dormitory who has shown himself very c able. Having dormitory boys 1 year who had been here some t. has been a great help for all h shown themselves so very depe able and willing during this h siege. DORMITORIES Each year we are more fully c winced that the time and money u in supervising and providing a home life for our students who too far from the school to walk b and forth is well spent. The year we have had from six to boys and from eight to twelve g in the dormitories. Each stud has had regular hours of labor practically have had to look out all school expenses without any from home. Three boys had homes so their problems were larger ; how to earn enough fo new pair of overalls or shirt c hair cut in addition to all other penses. More than half of the mitory students finished their w here this spring so these places be filled this fall by new pupils. We have been most fortunat, having Mrs. Morgan in the g dormitory and to take care of meals for all this large family Iv] numbers now from thirty-five forty-five all the time. Mrs. I\ gan has planned splendid meals her care and training of the THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI all that anyone could ask. difficult task and one that day and night for the seven the week.

This is a attired and willing family and everyone did his best le trying circumstances. By of the first month there was )f being settled and the secath brought real peace. lumbing and lighting for the t were all done by our own 'here is one other job to be ere this summer. Due to in family in the past few .e septic tank built ten years ago is inadequate and a new one must be put in this summer with new sewage lines. That will also be done by our men here. Mother made the move from the girls' to the boys' dormitory last fall and found the boys as nice to deal with as the girls. Discipline in either dormitory is not difficult but when one is willing and interested she can find plenty to do at either place and that kind of work requires being constantly with it. The past year two rooms in the teachers' cottage have been used by the boys, one for a dressing and wash room, one for a clubroom. The cottage in which they lived was too far for them to get to during the day. This summer we have rented the Jim Reagan cottage, which ad-joins our property and is near enough for all the needs of the boys. While the cottage is small the lo-cation so near the school will repay any other inconveniences they may have. The same schedule of work has been held to this year as last, the girls getting experience in practically every kind of work pertaining to homemaking, the boys in every-thing relating to stock and farm as well as general repair and up-keep work. LOCAL LABOR Not only the student labor but all the outside work has been done more satisfactorily the past year than ever before. Arlie Watson has taken care of furnaces and odd tasks during the winter, during the spring and summer has had a wonderful garden (which i used to supply our tables and also families who live in the Burg during the summer) and of course kept up many other duties. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 79 He and Otha Reagan make a fine team. Ernest Reagan continues to be with us and is the man for wiring, plumbing, repairing anything and everything. Two local girls who received some training in the evening class in home economics have done the cooking. Lillie Reagan continues as the nurse's assistant. We have eight local people on the pay roll and are proud of every one of them. WEAVING Again we can report continued growth in this department. While there have been the usual number of new products added to the Shop, things beautiful and decidedly sale-able, there has been a marked development in the real knowledge of the mechanics and art of weaving among the women. It has taken great effort to keep the weaving divided as equally and evenly among the people as possible and during the year forty-six women wove for the school, also four high school girls earned money in this way to continue school next year. Supervising weaving in fifty homes is a full-time task but the products show how well it is done. In addition to the individual instruction there have been six group meetings, with from sixteen to thirty women in attendance. These are possible since the new weaving room is finished. The new weaving, office, and storage rooms are almost too good to be true, and have relieved the stress" and strain in that department and other places too. Last spring the Smith Hughes vocational funds reimbursed us for the instruction given the afternoon class of women and with this money we employed Alice McCarter thisyear as assistant to Miss Redding. Alice is one of our local girls who has woven for us for years and is called the "loom doctor" because of being so expert in diagnosing and treating loom troubles of all kinds. I am glad to report that once again we have our regular classes in weaving for our school girls. The seventh and eighth grade girls have had two periods each day during the year, Alice and Miss Red-ding doing the teaching. Four new looms were gotten before school opened and three others rebuilt. With new weaving room and new looms, the results were most satisfactory. We are expecting reimbursement from the state again and hope that Alice will be able to continue her work another year. Weaving in the homes continues through every month of the year. Beginning with the first of January they start planning and working out new patterns and products for the next Christmas sales. There are still many more women who would like to weave but the present number is all that can be taken care of by the present weaving and Arrow-craft staffs. Both departments are working now to full capacity and it will be necessary after another year or two to discuss future development. The remarkable growth and development of the weaving department the past four years shows how efficient Winogene Redding has been and what a loss the school will sustain by her leaving. She has a thorough knowledge of her work and a most sympathetic understanding of the women with whom she has dealings and they have responded to all instruction and ad-vice remarkably well. Weaving THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI .s are not easy to find but we ^ing to have one here by Aug ARROWCRAFT Arrowcraft again shows [ development.

Mr. Mattil's shop, where finishing is done, has shown the local men such a marked difference between indifferently made furniture and that made from well seasoned wood, carefully put together and sanded and ready to be finished, that the men themselves have made marked progress in their work. The shop handles quite a good many finished articles as well as the unfinished stools and chairs. Although our main broom maker moved where he could "see the trucks pass all day and hear them of a night" other makers have been developed so we still.can supply the demand. The Gift Shop is not open on Sundays, to the dismay of a great many Pi Phis as well as other tourists, but we have felt we should take this stand. Last fall new price lists were printed and this spring an attractive cut has been made for all Arrow-craft products. The expense of the Arrowcraft Shop, the weaving department, part of the office expense, and extra help necessary during the rush season is met by the industrial department and we feel sure that all this considered there will be a profit again this year. But were we able to only come out even we would feel it all worth while. The $22,000 in cash paid all these weavers, basket, furniture and broom makers, quilters, hookers, and tufters means a real livelihood to one hundred families. Clubs and shop have been able to work together better than ever before each having a better under-standing of the needs of the other. No other school I know of has the splendid market we have and we surely value it most highly. All we REPORTS OF OFFICERS 81 have said concerning splendid club cooperation is sincere. ADMINISTRATION AND PUBLICITY Again, in this department as well as others, the same policies have been followed as in the year previous. The Gatlinburg News has been sent out each month to many local people, all officers of the fraternity, to each settlement chairman of the clubs, to those on the isolated alum-n lists, and to a good many individuals. With this has gone a let-ter from the school telling of the various departments and activities. These letters have also gone to the active chapters. An effort has been made to keep the letters short enough to be read easily and quickly at club and chapter meetings. With the increased business of the Arrowcraft there has been more and more to do in the office. A good many old accounts that have been on the books for years have been settled and the new accounts have been settled more promptly. The large business carried on and the tremendous amount of money necessarily advanced to maintain the department mean that we have had to have payments made more promptly than in former years. Clubs and individuals have responded splendily. Each year the student labor ac-counts are carried in a more business-like manner by both pupils and school and that again brings much added office work. The annual Mountain Workers Conference met in Knoxville the first week in April and a number of our staff attended some of the sessions at least. The conference isalways an inspiration and the contacts made with those from other schools is most helpful and pleasant. Following the conference we had the usual number of visitors to our school. In the fall I was in Berea four days, spending the entire time in observing work in various departments. Miss Cooke, Miss Allen, Miss Moore, and Mr. Mattil also visited Berea College. We received a great help in the line of publicity this year when Mr. and Mrs. Charles Rogers, of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, published and gave to the school for distribution, 10,000 copies of a leaflet telling of the history and activities of the school. This has met a long-felt need. COUNTY HEALTH UNIT Again I want to explain the way in which we cooperate with the county in the maintenance of a health unit. Instead of paying the nurse's salary directly to her it goes through the state health department, with appropriations from one other school in the county and from the county court. These funds are matched by state and federal funds, making a sufficient income for a county nurse, county health physician, and sanitary specialist these in addition to the nurses in the two schools. The state also furnishes free typhoid, smallpox, toxin-antitoxin serums, and other supplies. There is every promise of the best unit this year that we have ever had and the big objective for the year is sanitating the entire county. For this big task the state is furnishing additional assistance to the present staff.

Our health physician holds clinics .rious inoculations and assists he school program our nurse :o carry out in this district. :ounty health unit has set a sk for itself that of sanita-'or entire county. The )f seeing that every home, , and church has a sanitary is a sufficient piece of work to keep two men busy for months to come. Yet sanitation is the thing needed and I believe that a reason-able amount of cooperation will come from the people. The additional appropriation from the county court is providing men for this extra work. Our nurse now has a car, the state paying the upkeep of it. While a car will not take the place of a horse it many times saves a great deal of time and hard riding and with so many better roads seems a necessity. It also is a great convenience in taking patients to Knoxville for examination and treatment as the school truck is not always available nor very comfortable for trips of that kind. Six first year high school girls took the course in home nursing and care of the sick and received state certificates. During the summer Frances has organized two Little Mothers classes. These meet two afternoons each week and undoubtedly are the cutest things you ever saw. She gives the children instruction in how to care for their baby brothers and sisters and it is a course that some of the older ones might be proud to take. Two high school girls who had taken the home hygiene and care of the sick course assisted at the last tonsil clinic and demonstrated that their study had not been spent in vain. Two children were taken to the Trachoma Hospital for treatment and several others were given examinations. A Knoxville specialist gave two days for examining eyes and fitting glasses, saving us many hard trips to Knoxville with children. REPORTS OF OFFICERS 83 COMMUNITY It often seems that we do very little in real community work, yet we probably touch the people much more than we realize. Our crying need these days is a real social worker, one who can give Saturdays and Sundays to the young people who spend their time in the Burg with nothing to do. Library and reading room should be kept open. Books and magazines are here but no one with time enough to devote to keeping playrooms and reading rooms open. During the winter the auditorium was used by the community basket-ball team, Mr. Overton giving much of his time to their practice and games. There have been movies two nights each week since the first of May and they will continue through the summer. This year Arlie Watson and Ernest Reagan are the managers. It is difficult to always get the kind of films we want but on the whole the pictures are fairly good. Old Timers Day is one of the great events of the year, bringing many families in for a real get-together day. The Gatlinburg Fair continues to be the big day of the year. Between 500 and 600 school pupils from Gatlinburg and nearby communities join in the school parade and take part in athletic events during the day. The exhibits are of a high grade and truly "a good time is had by all." We believe it would be worth while to hold it two days in-stead of one. Our Christmas entertainment and tree, the plays during the school year always bring a house full of attentive people. It is our plan tohave more in the line of entertainment and educational addresses now that we have an auditorium. The university and state departments are always more than willing to be of help. Several teachers have had Sunday School classes and usually some at-tend the preaching services which now come twice a month instead of only once. The country church never does develop as fast as school and business do, unfortunately, yet there is a wonderful field waiting for someone to work in. Even though good roads and cars make it very easy for us and for the people here to take their recreation elsewhere we all feel that there is a great need for the home and community social life. EMMA HARPER TURNER CENTER SUGARLANDS The extension school and community work at Sugarlands continues to be one of our most interesting pieces of work. Emily Burton joined the Sugar-lands staff, after ten years in the Gatlinburg school. Eva Hathaway returned for her second year there. Mrs. Dowell left the Burg and be-came housemother and community worker in Sugarlands. These made a fine team. The two girls had the school work, and of course much community work too. Mrs. Dowell took care of the home, taught cooking and sewing, and helped with different outside things. In the winter Mrs. Dowell spent a week at the University of Tennessee for the farm women's short course and came back with plenty of ideas to work out with the local women. One was the making of rugs, hooked and braided.

You have your own home life with a small family, you come close to the people around you and it seems as though you can see more being accomplished from day to day than in a larger center. Perhaps we in Gatlinburg sometimes are a little envious. PERMANENT IMPROVEMENTS AND REPAIRS 1928-29 Stuart Cottage : reroof, laundry improved and heated, new water heater and tank installed, coal storage made.

It will take careful planning for another two years to get it all paid for and into anything like an easy financial condition but it will come and in the meantime we know that there will be the best possible response from clubs and chapters and we in turn will be as careful as possible of the expenditures here. Our school has never had many large gifts from individuals and even a building pro-gram is carried on largely from the regular donations of the year which make up the budget. No extra drives for funds have been made and it is a real accomplishment to have the new building as nearly paid for as it is under these circumstances. During the winter the treasury was in a most pitiful condition and it was necessary to give a cry of distress. It surely was answered and month by month funds have come in to keep us going but it continues to be a hard struggle for the treasurer. All are glad that this year is behind us and we can start on a new one. .A big task brings a challenge that no doubt is good for us all. Again I want to express my appreciation of the help that has come from officers, clubs, and chapters and for the splendid cooperation of each one on the staff. Each letter, each visit, and each check has helped more than you can realize. Respectfully submitted, EvELYN BISHOP ARROWCRAFT REPORT So much attention has been given in the past few years to the finding for and marketing of the Arrow-craft products that very little atten-tion has been given to those who make the products especially the furniture and basket makers. This past year things have been so organized that we have known bet-ter what we wanted the people to make. The clubs are becoming more familiar with the products and know better what they can and can-not sell. Their orders have come in earlier and they have been free in saying what they felt were best sellers. With every order there has been much correspondence which we feel sure has resulted in better understanding between the clubs and the shop and has been of in-valuable help in timely final settlements. By appealing to the people's pride we have been able to bring up the standards of the baskets. They are beginning to realize they are only hurting themselves when they make a poor basket. When.two or three arrive at the same time you can always hear them criticising one another's baskets bragging on the good points at times but more often pointing out the bad ones. In this way I feel they have helped one another more than we could ever have, regardless of how much we might have talked and scolded. I believe that Mr. Mattil's shop has done more to bring up the standard of the furniture than any-thing ever has or ever could have done. For over two years I talked seasoned wood, sand paper, and, a lot of care in making but I didn't get very far. After Mr. Mattil started his shop I had some things finished to use as samples. The furniture makers seemed amazed to think the things they made "just old common settin' chairs" could be made to look so pretty. One comment THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI : "I 'low that's pretty enough t in anybody's house." It Lied that they always had the that furniture was just rough f that didn't matter much and re wasn't any need in spending t of time on it. One of the best :ers seemed very interested in ing out how it was done, spend-an entire morning asking ques-.s. My curiosity was aroused so ;ked him what he was planning .o. Then he told me he was maksome black walnut chairs for [self and was going to finish n. I felt then that something really been accomplished. Just long we will be able to get the kets and chairs no one knows as 1y of the people have sold out the Park and of course that ins they can no longer cut the )d. here is just one woman and her ghter that do the tufting on the [I mats and bed spreads. She ught her first things to the Shop rly two years ago and they were ful attempts. She appealed to s's sympathy and by encouraging [ suggestions as to colors, etc., we re been able to help her until now one could ask for lovelier things n those she brings in. Ve have had our first quilts this r and have been very fortunate vetting them. Instead of starting h an inexperienced person we re begun with a master quilter. s. Hatcher and her mother-in-., from Wears Valley, do the Ming and I have never seen love-. We have only the full bed size its but hope to eventually work aby crib covers, comforts, etc. hrough Mrs. Dowell's effort we .e had a few hooked mats from Sugarlands. However, we hope to concentrate on braided rugs there and leave the hooking to the women who have been doing it for so long. We have never had any braided rugs but feel there is a market for them. The buying requires more time than it once did, for in these busy days we do not have the opportunity for home visiting and our greatest contact comes through the Shop visiting. This year we have had two exhibits at fairs one at the East Tennessee Division State Fair and one at the Tri-State Fair at Memphis. It was the first exhibit we had had at Knoxville of our industrial products. The fair association there, was not allowed to pay the expenses of the exhibit but did give us a premium of $75 which took care of all expenses. The alumnae club of Memphis had charge of the exhibit there (which was the fourth we have had) and bore all expenses. At both places a loom was used to demonstrate. At last we have a tag to mark all Arrowcraft products and one which everyone will like. I feel sure the clubs will welcome these. The price list was revised in the summer and this, with a letter of explanation and a club, or wholesale price list, was sent to each club in the fall. The circulars given to us by Mr. Rogers, of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, have been a world of help as hardly any-one comes into the Shop that doesn't want something that tells about the school. While the gross amount shipped isn't so much greater this year than last there has been less returned for credit. This is a result of smaller orders to more clubs. To date the gross sales have been REPORTS OF OFFICERS 87 $26,201.55 returned for credit $5,981.18. Net business $20,220.37. To ninety-eight people bringing things to the Shop we have paid $22,374.53, an average of $228.31 to each person. Taking the fifty weavers out and the $6,711.59 paid them, it leaves forty-eight basket makers, broom tyers, furniture makers, hookers, tufters and quilters receiving a total of $15,662.94. Everything recommended last year has been carried out with the exception of the water and toilet facilities in the Shop. With so many other improvements being made there never seemed to be a time when the necessary labor was available. We expect to get this done during the summer. There is only one recommendation I feel should be made this year. That is for a Shop in the new Mountain View Hotel which is to be erected this coming winter. I have talked to Mr. Huff about it and he says there is a space in the hotel for such a shop as we would want and that as long as the school is here and wants the space no one else shall have it. I feel sure the space can be leased for a nominal sum. We know that we are not getting our share of the tourist trade and this shop may be a possible solution. There are pros and cons that will need to be carefully discussed at committee meeting. Respectfully submitted, LADELLE ALLEN WEAVING REPORT Another year has come and gone and it is time once more for an annual report. This year I feel as if somethingdefinite has been accomplished among the women of the community. It is hard to put into words, as it is more a feeling of satisfaction that the educational goal that I have been striving toward for four years is in sight at last, than it is a condition that can be seen or expressed in so many sentences. It may be due in part to knowing the women more thoroughly, realizing the shortcomings of each woman and so knowing just how to handle the individual cases in order to give everyone the weaving help best suited to make her happy and satisfied. This only comes from long acquaintance and congenial workers. Working conditions are ideal now and have helped wonderfully to make the work run smoothly. The office, supply room, and large weaving room are in constant use. Sup-plies can be kept in better condition and more easily handled, saving much time. The office makes a convenient and necessary place for the women to bring in their weaving, and get material and receive directions for their weekly weaving. The class room is used the year around: for classes during the school year; several women use the warping bars and it gives a place where the women of the en-tire community can gather for group instruction, a most necessary part of the work, and until this year not available because of lack of space. I have found that the women respond enthusiastically to group instruction and the few meetings we have been able to hold have made the women much more independent in a technical way. They are gradually becoming more expert in the mechanics of weaving due to the rigid campaign held throughout THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI ar for looms in perfect work--Eder and the emphasis put on trly stages of warping, beamnd threading. They can take ions about draft and pattern in an intelligent manner. ction of detail and a high a.rd of every part of the work axing a great deal to do with jlendicl grade of weaving the n bring to us. individual work done during revious years has prepared omen for this group instructs it laid a foundation which 5 it possible to absorb knowlin large portions.

This [ am giving the weaving only. From June 1, 1928, to May 17, 1929, we have bought from the women $6,711.59 worth of weaving. More women have their own warping bars so only fifty-nine warps have been made on the school bars. Between September 18, 1928, and December 15, 1928, and February 11, 1929, and May 17, 1929, there have been 621 calls on weaving business only and I have made 117 calls in the homes. The school class was successful. Alice McCarter taught the class practical weaving and I gave the notebook work. There were seven in the class, seventh and eighth grade girls. They paid for the materials they used by weaving towels and selling them to the school. Alice helped me in many other ways and proved to be a valuable assistant. I have tried to spread out the weaving among more families by limiting each home to one loom and keeping the weaving in Gatlinburg and vicinity. There are four young girls weaving this summer to earn money to go to high school next fall, making a total of fifty weavers this year. From my experience I believe that to supervise fifty women and to visit fifty homes located in various degrees of distance and accessibility is all that one person can do successfully. The work seems to be at a good place to pass on to someone else. There have been the usual amount of trials and tribulations, jealousy among the weavers, etc., but I have enjoyed my work here to the utmost and I regret that I have to give it up.
