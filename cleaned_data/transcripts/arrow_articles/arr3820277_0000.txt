        276 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI pity women in Miami with their addresses and telephone numbers. This book is prefaced by the request that all visiting fraternity women call on their sisters and become a member of our Association. Panhellenic has two meetings each month: one for business followed by a social hour, and the other a luncheon which is enlivened in many ways. Songs of each fraternity are sung, and such interesting persons as Mrs. Robert M. Seymour, Mrs. Reginal Owen and Mary C. McDougal, a poet of some note, have spoken to us. The latter surprised us one day with a number of "Panhellenic Jingles." Our singers quickly took up the call and now Mary's jingles are heard on every apt occasion. VIDA PEENE, '19, Ontario A, University of Toronto. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON (Items of interest contributed by EvELYN BISHOP, Head Resident) The weaving room is now a very busy place. Three looms were added this fall and several women of the community are learning to use them. One has already finished paying for her own loom by selling her work the past summer. All of this goes to show that our efforts to revive interest in an industry which was rapidly becoming a lost art, are meeting with success. Aunt Lydia still makes baskets but all she can provide together with those made by others hardly keep us supplied. More orders came in November than we usually have in a whole year. The past year has been the banner one for baskets. The Andy Ogle house has been wired, running water has been put in and a good many changes have been made. Specialists from Nashville and Knoxville who have inspected it all agree that we have a very convenient place for work. Nurse Higgenbotham al-ready has installed her office there and our long anticipated Jennie Nicol Memorial will soon be a reality. The March ARROW will contain details of this new branch of our work. Miss Chew, our principal, has visited several of the nearby schools this fall. The Pi Beta Phi School is now making its influence felt through the efforts of some of our former pupils who are teaching in the little isolated school houses in various partS of the county:. this NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 277 year Mattie Ogle Watson is teaching Fork of the River school; Elmer Watson, Sugarlands; Elder Ogle, Baskins; and Emma Maples, Brackins. Emma's school is the last one in Tennessee before crossing the North Carolina border. She has already interested two girls who live in that isolated spot to come to the Pi Beta Phi School. Through the efforts of these teachers who have been trained in our school and the visits which the nurse makes far up the creeks and hollows, we hope to enroll many more boys and girls. Mrs. Anna Dowell of Indianola, Iowa, who came to the school in October is proving a very valuable addition to the staff. Her duties are varied but she is especially helpful to Miss Bishop in assisting in community visiting. SETTLEMENT SCHOOL CLASS WORK (Note: The following creed and poem written for English class work by one of our Settlement School boys are splendid illustrations of the progress which the students are making. EDITOR.) A MOUNTAIN Boy's CREED Living away back in the mountains out of sight, with no one to look on and cheer, I try to put the very best there is in me into everything I do. I also try to do my work right. I live, work and study until there is nothing left of me, but the world is richer and better for what I do. Let me keep on going the same way is all I ask. OCTOBER Oh, to be in the mountains in October, After the hurry of summer is over, Out of town now so gray and so sober, Back to the joys of nature once more. The trees in the forest are shading with yellow, The aster and golden rod cover the land, The colors of autumn are everywhere mellow, The wonder of nature is on every hand. ARLIE MCCARTER, Gatlinburg, Tenn. The Southern Highlander and His Homeland By JOHN C. CAmpBELL Published by Russell Sage Foundation, New York, 1921. Price $3.5o Net Reviewed by SARAH POMEROY RUGO Many volumes have been written on the southern mountains and their inhabitants and in consequence many fallacies are current about this section of the country and the people who dwell therein. Writers 278 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI of romances fascinated by the simple beauty of Highland life have over-emphasized certain features, and authors of more serious books have been prone to generalize, have failed to make distinctions between the urban and rural population and often have published inaccurate statements. This unfortunate publicity has given rise to a difficult situation which every mountain worker has been forced to face more or less frequently. The mountaineer has suffered so much in consequence that his natural suspicion of the people in the outside world has been intensified and because of this many trusted and well-informed mountain workers have hesitated to print their impressions and observations. Such a worker was John C. Campbell, author of The Southern Highlander and his Homeland, who labored for more than twenty-five years among the people of the Southern Highlands and who was at the time of his death secretary of the Southern Highland Division of the Russell Sage Foundation. Again and again he was urged. to write the results of his experiences but always he refused realizing as he did "the difficulties in the way of writing of a people who, while forming a definite geographical and racial group were by no means socially homogeneous." Not until the last year of his life did he consent to edit his mass of notes and material for publication. Death came before his manuscript was completed but it was so thoroughly outlined that his wife was able to prepare it for publication. The result is a volume of great value to all who are in any way associated with work in the Southern Highlands and one of genuine interest to everyone who is desirous of obtaining a fair and just estimate of the people and conditions in this particular part of our country. Mr. Campbell deals exhaustively with the backgrounds and history of the population of the Southern Highlands, describing most entertainingly the pioneer routes of travel and early settlements and tracing the ancestry of the present population. He concludes that "the vast majority of the Highlanders are descendants of settlers who were native born, and who, by their common interests hardships and struggles, were blended into a homogeneous people the type which has come to be called `American.' " He then pictures most realistically and sympathetically the present Highland population, discussing at length the Highlander's individualism in its various aspects, his religious life, his home conditions and health. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 279 This exhaustive study of the subject closes with chapters devoted to the resources of the mountain country and their development, suggested avenues for contact and progress and a plea for a new basis of appeal for interest. The volume is so enriched with anecdote and description and so replete .7'vith pertinent paragraphs that it is difficult not to quote at length. The following passage is only one of many which are full of suggestion: "In time and the time in sonic places is at hand, the isolation of the Highlands will be overcome by railroads and good thoroughfares and their wild beauty disfigured by commercial exploitation, while the Highlander himself, his individualism and his picturesqueness gone, will become no better, no worse, but quite as uninteresting as other men. "He who stands where once the Tallulah River in northern Georgia leaped, a foaming torrent of waterfalls and rapids through a gray gorge whose steep sides were set with moss and bloom, cannot but regret the passing of that beauty. He knows that the electricity generated by that immense volume of water passes a hundred miles or more to cities which have never seen its source but something has gone from out the land not only of beauty but of strength. "It is the part of those, both native and foreign, who have the interest of the Highland country at heart, to see that all that is strong and fair in that life is not drained away to other regions. It should be a reservoir clean and beautiful in itself, ministering to its own needs yet the source from which the exhausted pools of urban life may find renewal and refreshment." In that passage, it seems to the reviewer, is a message for our fraternity and a challenge to us to continue the work we are trying to accomplish in one little district of the Southern Highlands in such a manner that we may in truth make the place in which we are particularly concerned a "reservoir clean and beautiful in itself yet a source of refreshment" to the world outside. The book deserves thoughtful and, careful reading from all of us who are trying to better conditions in the Southern Highlands.
