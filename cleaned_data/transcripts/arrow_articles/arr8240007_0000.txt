        Lolita Snell Prouty . 1966 Convention Guest The name Prouty has become synonymous with devoted interest and service in Pi Beta Phi. Thus it is fitting that Lolita Snell Prouty is to be honored as the 1966 Convention Special Guest. Four generations of Pi Phi in this family began with the initiation of Evalyn Barney Snell into Colorado Alpha in 1885, the first chapter initiate after a charter was granted. Lolita became a Colorado Alpha Pi Phi in 1911 and graduated from the University of Colorado in 1914 with B.A., B.E., and M.A., degrees having completed work on these degrees in four school years and one summer session. She was a Phi Beta Kappa. Despite her heavy scholastic schedule, she had served her chapter as corresponding secretary and vice president and was quite active on campus. She was a member of Hesperia and Mortar Board, was president of the Women's Athletic Association, president of the YWCA and Associate Editor of the Coloradan. She married her Beta Theta Pi sweetheart, Frank H. Prouty of Denver in 1916 and they will celebrate their 50th anniversary this year. Mr. Prouty is one of Colorado's most distinguished engineers. The Prouty's have three daughters, Evalyn Hick-man, Caroline Shreve and Jane Percella, all members of Colorado Alpha. Now there are three Prouty granddaughters wearing the Arrow. They are Tia and Lyn Hickman, Colorado Gamma and Sara Shreve, Colorado Alpha. Lolita was a member of the Settlement School Committee from 1941 to 1946. She served as Grand Treasurer from 1945 until 1952, when she assumed the office of Counselor for Chapter House Corporation for four years. She has been a member of the Board of Trustee Funds since 1946. In 1940, she and her mother and her two older daughters Evalyn and Caroline attended the Pi Beta Phi Convention. She and her three daughters have been in attendance at several conventions since that time and Tia Hickman was with them at Washing-ton in 1962. This year the honored mother, the daughters and the granddaughters are all looking forward to being in Gatlinburg together. Asked to comment on the occasion and Pi Beta Phi's role in Gatlinburg, Lolita said, "I feel very proud to have been invited to be the Special Guest of the 1966 Pi Beta Phi Convention, and very humble too, as I realize I represent so many other Pi Phis who have had love and devotion for the Settlement School and given of their time and effort to further the work in the Gatlinburg community. The foremost of these was Amy Onken, and it was Lolita Snell Prouty through my friendship with her that I first de veloped my interest in and love for the School and was asked to serve on the Committee. Pi Phi's accomplishments over the years have been many, not only in the field of education, but in health service and the furthering of the craft program which has helped to furnished a livelihood to many families through the development of their native crafts and the sale of their products to Arrowcraft. For years Pi Beta Phi was also the center of community life in Gatlinburg, enlarging the horizons of the people and enriching their existence. Our health service and nurse gave invaluable aid not only to the babies and children but to adults as well. In the early days we helped the families on small farms to improve their stock and their farming methods by teaching agriculture in our school and having a model farm for them to work in. Through letting children from outlying districts live in our dormitories, they received financial help and training in gracious living, and because of what we brought to Gatlinburg, its citizens have been able to cope with the influx of tourists, and adapt to modern times. All these services brought enlightenment to an isolated community. Now times have changed and Sevier County and Gatlinburg have become more prosperous and able to finance their own schools, their health center and their community projects so that we can turn our attention away from these things to emphasize our Craft Program which has gained increasing notice over the years with Arrowcraft articles sold by most of our alumnae clubs, and because of the courses taught in our Summer Workshops to students com 6 THE ARROW OF N BETA PHI 7 ing from practically every state. Arrowcraft has be-come internationally known for the excellence of the articles produced. Our facilities at Gatlinburg are ideal for the contemplated enlargement of our Arts and Crafts Pro-gram to a year-around school so that our philanthropy can be extended beyond the confines of the community and we can visualize having (with the cooperation of the University of Tennessee) a craft school which will grow until it becomes a foremost Craft Center, known everywhere for the training it will be giving to craftsmen coming from all over the country and returning to their local communities to help in rehabilitation hospitals, schools for retarded children, and to teach handicapped people of all ages to help themselves be self supporting andable to lead happier, more normal lives. What finer goal could we have? And how could we be of better service? Too, we will be doing something in an uncrowded field and something other organizations like ours are not doing. So, I feel especially honored and proud that Grand Council has asked me to be the Special Guest of this Convention, where the Settlement School is the center of interest and where I hope our active girls and our alumnae will gain a knowledge of services accomplished, foresee what wonderful possibilities there are for the future and be able to carry all this back to the Pi Phis who were not blessed by being present, so that they too, will see the value of our program, give it their full support and be as proud of its accomplishments as it deserves."

EUGENIE ANDERSON (Continued from page 5) tries, Mr. Anderson noted particularly "How much we all have in common shared human values and hopes for a free and peaceful future." Considering the concern of many college students today with social and political problems, Mrs. Anderson believes "everyone should do the best that he or she can to better human relationships." Mrs. Anderson's latest post with the United Nations Trusteeship Council has again sent her travel-ling for her country. Accompanied by her husband, she recently visited Guam and the Pacific Islands Trust Territory with the House Committee on Insular and Territorial affairs. She has set-up residence in New York City, and considers this present assignment an opportunity to work for peace and international co-operation, human equality, and all the fundamental problems that confront our country. She feels "a deep responsibility to represent our country here to 117 member Nations of the United Nations, and to work to help our Trust Territory develop towards self-government and self-determination." The Encyclopedia Americana lists Mrs. Eugenie Anderson as "an American diplomat." To have achieved this distinction in her lifetime, and to have also developed her particular artistic talents, maintained her role of devoted wife and mother, and continued a world conscience which is still leading her to new areas where help is needed, places Mrs. Anderson in a position equaled by few women in any country, at any time.
