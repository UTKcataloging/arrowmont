At the age of four she was a member of its initial first grade class in 1912 and she has served many years as a teacher in that school.

Her invitation to membership came from Grand Council on the recommendation of the Little Pigeon Alumnae Club of Gatlinburg and Tennessee Gamma. Her initiation was particularly significant since it came in the golden anniversary year of the Settlement School with which she has been so closely identified throughout her life. Stella Sue Huff Cox Andy Huff's Daughter It was through the efforts of Sue's father, the late Andy J. Huff that the Pi Phis remained in Gatlinburg in 1912 and he remained a true friend of Pi Phi throughout his life.

After she had completed all the schooling offered by the School in its early years, she finished her high school work away from Gatlinburg and graduated from Maryville College, Maryville, Tenn. She then re-turned to Gatlinburg to teach high school English in the School and has given years of service as a teacher. For many years she served on the local Settlement School Committee (which no longer exists) that worked with the Pi Phi Settlement School Committee in solving many local problems. Through the years she has made many Pi Phi friends and one who is very dear to her is Miss Amy B. Onken, Honorary Grand President. She has always been a leader in civic and church work and presently is superintendent of the Baptist Church Junior Sunday School Department, sings in the church choir and is a Training Union Leader.
