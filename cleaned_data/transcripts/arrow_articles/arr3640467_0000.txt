        466 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI IN RETROSPECT GATLINBURG BEFORE THE COMING OF PI BETA PHI BY MABEL MOORE, GREENVILLE,. TENN. During the school year 1910 the teachers of Sevier County held institute once a month in different districts. In September we attended a meeting held in the old-time school building at Gatlin-burg, a very primitive one-room building, with long seats, no desks, very low ceiling, supported by poles to keep it from caving in. I IN RETROSPECT 467 believe there were six of these poles. At this meeting there were present teachers of the county, Superintendent Drinnen, Professor Goddard of Murphy College, Miss Dailey and myself of Wears Valley School. The leader of the Institute assigned us to homes. After reaching our stopping place the hostess confided in us and said "We want to get to a place where we can send our children to a good school when they get older. I wanted to see you and find out so I would know what kind of school you have over in the Valley." We did not forget the mother and her longing. One feature of our program was singing by four men. I accompanied them on a folding organ. When this part of the pro-gram began, each window and door which had been vacant was at once filled with many faces. Our meeting at night was well attended. We. gave more musical selections. During the afternoon and before our night meeting many questions were asked about the queer little organ, price, and who could play it. I have never forgotten the bright and eager faces of these boys and girls. I said to Miss Dailey, "All these people at Gatlinburg need is a light and a chance." Some weeks after this trip we attended a school rally at Sevierville for all teachers of thecounty. Here we heard Miss Turner, of Wash ington, who told of the desire of the organization she represented to locate a school in the mountains. I did not think of Ga.tlinburg just then but at noon on my way to the hotel I said, "Let us tell her of Gatlinburg," but we saw Miss Turner and friend talking with some business men so we let it pass. Later in the afternoon I suggested we go meet them and tell about Gatlinburg. We did so. Miss Turner said they would visit the place. You all know the visit was made and its results. After a few years I was permitted to go to Gatlinburg, after school and settlement work was started. It was a very wonderful transformation which I witnessed and I would like to see Gatlinburg as it is now. AUGUST, 1910 BY MAY LANSFIELD KELLER In the summer of 1910 a committee of three, consisting of .Miss Turner, Anna Pettit-Brownell, and the writer, were authorized by the Convention of 1910 held at Swarthmore, Pa., to investigate a site for a Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in the mountains of Eastern 468 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Tennessee. Making Knoxville our headquarters we made trips to various mountain sections and one to Madisonville where a substantial school house had already been erected. At that juncture it was necessary to come to some decision as to our future course, namely whether we should enter a town, take over certain buildings, equip others, and conduct a training school for teachers to be sent back into the mountains of whether the fraternity would be more interested in the actual work of teaching in the heart of the mountains. Pending a decision we determined on further investigation in the neighborhood Our Plant Today, reading from left to right: Stuart Cottage, "Old Cottage" (remodeled) Teachers' Residence-The School building pictured on p. 458 stands to the right of the Residence with a play-ground intervening. of the Great Smokies, but Miss Turner and Mrs. Brownell were both called away,. and I was left to inaugurate a personally conducted tour of my own. . It began with a long distance telephone message from Sevierville summoning me to appear there the next day where a mythical Mr. Drinnen would meet me at the train and drive me up into the mountains. Early the next morning at six-thirty I took my seat in the single passenger coach drawn by a miniature engine, which burned IN RETROSPECT 469 wood not coal, and we puffed, snorted, and panted our way up to Sevierville, the terminal of the toy road. Arrived at the station Mr. Drinnen, then County Superintendent of Schools and one of the firmest friends our school has ever had, met me, drove me to the hotel,, and left me with the assurance that at five the next morning he would call for me and drive me to Gatlinburg where there was a community with-out school facilities and without the prospect of obtaining any. The hotel was-crowded but an obliging daughter of the proprietor gave up A TYPICAL MOUNTAIN HOME her room and also her bed to me, in neither of which was it deemed necessary to make any change in preparation for the new occupant. The weather was warm, so I managed very well reclining at night on the outside of the bed with my own garments for covering. Fussy perhaps but none of you have seen the room or the bed. 'Early the next morning Mr. Drinnen appeared in a small light buggy. His greeting was "I sure am glad you came." On further inquiry I .elicited the information that I had "kind of that healthy 470 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI look," which was necessary to sustain one over seventeen miles of the worst road in Tennessee. At that time there were no bridges, the road to Pigeon Forge had not yet been built, and we forded creeks with the water up to the floor of the buggy. It was an interesting experience, however, and by the time we had run over a yellow dog, which had not energy enough to move, and which its owner "allowed had the hook worm," stopped to talk to three schools in no one of which had the teacher been beyond the fifth grade, but where all the children were pure Americans, intelligent and bright but shy and backward from forces of heredity and environment, I had come to the conclusion that here was a tremendous field for any fraternity with a vision. A FAMOUS Fox HUNTER AND HIS "COMPANION" After driving miles through the bottom lands we came in sight. of the Great Smokies and began to climb steadily. We finally reached Gatlinburg about noon but a different Gatlinburg from that of today. Not a two story house in the whole community, the IN RETROSPECT 471 largest one consisting of two rooms, a living room and bed-room combined, and a small kitchen. The entire population turned out to meet Mr. Drinnen and myself, and those bearded dark-eyed men meant business when they found that I was neither a religious propagandist, a Catholic, nor some one to sell them goods. They did not understand why the fraternity was interested, but if "them women" wanted to give them a school they were mighty sure they would be glad to have it for their children. They were slow to speak in public, and I gained much more information afterward on the porch of the Ogle house, where we were taken for dinner, and where the men congregated to meet "that woman." For the first time I was introduced to the mountain custom of the men sitting down to the table and the women serving, to which however I have since grown accustomed. It was also a little novel to be asked "how old be ye," "be ye married," "why ben't ye married," "ye be old enough," etc., but it was kindly interest. and well meant. After a dinner of "snaps, corn dodger, coffee, tomatoes, and pie" we discussed very earnestly the proposition of a school and if 'ever people wanted an education these did. I could promise nothing, but after good byes were said and Mr. Drinnen had told me on the homeward drive the needs of the community I resolved to send a strong recommendation to the committee that the fraternity locate a school in the mountains and consider the needs of Gatlinburg particularly in seeking a location. To those of THE ARROW readers accustomed to seeing pictures of trim cottages and well clothed children as typical views of the Settlement School and its pupils, I may say that much of these pleasant prospects are due to the earnest work and self sacrifice of our teachers. Others are to tell of later events, but in closing I wish to speak of the marvelous changes I observed on my last visit to the school in the summer of 1918. Mr. Huff was 'running a hotel to which people were coming from Knoxville and elsewhere for the wonderful trout fishing. A little further along was Mr. Maples' house enlarged and with a second story, a new store was going up, fields were being tilled, the people were better dressed and looked as if they had a more active interest in affairs, and I heard rumors of the railroad coming through. Crowning it all were the school buildings with the splendid new up-to-date teachers' cottage with a real bath-room and the Stuart Cottage, both carefully planned by Mrs. Helmick. I lived IN RETROSPECT 4 of the big boys, and I went ,down to Mr. Ogle's store Christmas morning and bought out their supply of ties at cost. You see, we had hoped up to the last minute that the boxes would come. We also got paper sacks at the store and oranges, candy and peanuts. It was not expensive and it was not what we wanted to do, but the children were happy and so it is well. People began to come Christmas morning before we were through our breakfast; in fact, some had breakfast with us, and the children came in. I showed them my things and put them to work filling the sacks and taking baskets over to the school house. We took our window shades down from the cottage and put them up at the school as we wanted to have the candles lighted and it was necessary to give the tree in the day time on account of the small children. Miss Hill was really ill and tired out from being up the night before with the sick, so I took the twenty-five babies in a basket and three under my arm and with the boys and girls with their bundles, we started. I lost my rubbers many times and my good nature was at such low ebb by the time we had made, the crest of the hill that as soon as I got my breath I made a regular suffragette speech. I just announced that I had made my last trip through that mud. Of course I didn't proclaim it from the hill-tops : just said it to the big boys who were helping me array the tree but it didn't take ten minutes for everyone in the "burg" to be discussing it. We got everything on the tree and kept the doors locked while we did it the children were all there and simply expiring to get a peek. The men were just as curious. There were about three hundred people at the affair. They never have family dinners nor ever have Christmas trees at home. But the thing that surprised me most of all was that they know absolutely nothing of the religious idea of Christmas. I had told my room the story of the "Little Boy's Visit to Santa Claus," just from my remembrance of Mr. Wylie's telling it years ago, and they were the best audience I have ever seen. From that time on I had no rest from their entreaties to tell them another story, so the last day of school I had the little people cut out and color Christmas pictures and also took a beautiful picture of the shepherds following the star and tacked it up after explaining to them. I told them the old, old story of Mary and Joseph. Not one of my fifty and more bdys and girls 474 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI knew who Mary was nor had any conception of the beauty of the Christmas from the religious standpoint. It is surprising, as these people are supposed to be religious, if nothing else, and it seems as if the Bible 'stories might have been handed down by word of mouth, if nothing else. After we had everything on the tree I asked Mr. Ephriam Ogle to go for Miss Hill, as I don't believe she ever would have made it through the mud. He hitched up the big mule and brought the lady back in no time, and thankful she was for the transit. The Christmas tree was a huge holly. The children said that they always had holly so I was willing as long as they were doing it for their pleasure and not mine but we had a terrible time making the candles stay on, succeeding after a fashion. I much prefer our own beautiful evergreen myself, although this looked very pretty with ,the colored chains, strings of holly berries and popcorn. We had just a musical program, preceded by a short talk and prayer, and every-thing was lovely until Mr. and Mrs. Santa arrived. You see, we never dreamed that anyone here would carry out our ideas of a Santa Claus, and having it in the daytime, we decided it would be better to let the big boys distribute the presents, but at the very last minute they came to me and asked if I didn't think it would be more fun for the children to have Santa. I was delighted, and told them by all means if there was anyone in the burg who would do it. Imagine my consternation when an old darky and his wife appeared and began the burlesque. Well, we had to laugh and make the best of it but can you imagine that conception of the jolly old saint! They were doing it in all kindness as Mrs. Santa was our trusty youth 'and Santa himself, the young man who had. just been licensed. to preach. When they began making personal remarks we called Mr. Santa over and told him to be brief and asked Charlie Ogle and one of the other big boys to assist us, or we would have been there all night. And so the thing finally ended with the children happy, which is the big thing. We came home and opened our mail, indulged in a Christmas lunch of good things, and went to bed at seven o'clock, so weary that nary a. Christmas dream came. IN RETROSPECT 475 A TEACHERS' DAY IN 1914 BY MARIE DITMARS [Those who work in Gatlinburg or visit it today can hardly realize the hardships and difficulties which our workers endured in the earlier years of the project.

Of course I didn't proclaim it from the hill-tops : just said it to the big boys who were helping me array the tree but it didn't take ten minutes for everyone in the "burg" to be discussing it. We got everything on the tree and kept the doors locked while we did it the children were all there and simply expiring to get a peek. The men were just as curious. There were about three hundred people at the affair. They never have family dinners nor ever have Christmas trees at home. But the thing that surprised me most of all was that they know absolutely nothing of the religious idea of Christmas. I had told my room the story of the "Little Boy's Visit to Santa Claus," just from my remembrance of Mr. Wylie's telling it years ago, and they were the best audience I have ever seen. From that time on I had no rest from their entreaties to tell them another story, so the last day of school I had the little people cut out and color Christmas pictures and also took a beautiful picture of the shepherds following the star and tacked it up after explaining to them. I told them the old, old story of Mary and Joseph. Not one of my fifty and more bdys and girls 474 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI knew who Mary was nor had any conception of the beauty of the Christmas from the religious standpoint. It is surprising, as these people are supposed to be religious, if nothing else, and it seems as if the Bible 'stories might have been handed down by word of mouth, if nothing else. After we had everything on the tree I asked Mr. Ephriam Ogle to go for Miss Hill, as I don't believe she ever would have made it through the mud. He hitched up the big mule and brought the lady back in no time, and thankful she was for the transit. The Christmas tree was a huge holly. The children said that they always had holly so I was willing as long as they were doing it for their pleasure and not mine but we had a terrible time making the candles stay on, succeeding after a fashion. I much prefer our own beautiful evergreen myself, although this looked very pretty with ,the colored chains, strings of holly berries and popcorn. We had just a musical program, preceded by a short talk and prayer, and every-thing was lovely until Mr. and Mrs. Santa arrived. You see, we never dreamed that anyone here would carry out our ideas of a Santa Claus, and having it in the daytime, we decided it would be better to let the big boys distribute the presents, but at the very last minute they came to me and asked if I didn't think it would be more fun for the children to have Santa. I was delighted, and told them by all means if there was anyone in the burg who would do it. Imagine my consternation when an old darky and his wife appeared and began the burlesque. Well, we had to laugh and make the best of it but can you imagine that conception of the jolly old saint! They were doing it in all kindness as Mrs. Santa was our trusty youth 'and Santa himself, the young man who had. just been licensed. to preach. When they began making personal remarks we called Mr. Santa over and told him to be brief and asked Charlie Ogle and one of the other big boys to assist us, or we would have been there all night. And so the thing finally ended with the children happy, which is the big thing. We came home and opened our mail, indulged in a Christmas lunch of good things, and went to bed at seven o'clock, so weary that nary a. Christmas dream came.

TENN. During the school year 1910 the teachers of Sevier County held institute once a month in different districts. In September we attended a meeting held in the old-time school building at Gatlin-burg, a very primitive one-room building, with long seats, no desks, very low ceiling, supported by poles to keep it from caving in. I IN RETROSPECT 467 believe there were six of these poles. At this meeting there were present teachers of the county, Superintendent Drinnen, Professor Goddard of Murphy College, Miss Dailey and myself of Wears Valley School. The leader of the Institute assigned us to homes. After reaching our stopping place the hostess confided in us and said "We want to get to a place where we can send our children to a good school when they get older. I wanted to see you and find out so I would know what kind of school you have over in the Valley." We did not forget the mother and her longing. One feature of our program was singing by four men. I accompanied them on a folding organ. When this part of the pro-gram began, each window and door which had been vacant was at once filled with many faces. Our meeting at night was well attended. We. gave more musical selections. During the afternoon and before our night meeting many questions were asked about the queer little organ, price, and who could play it. I have never forgotten the bright and eager faces of these boys and girls. I said to Miss Dailey, "All these people at Gatlinburg need is a light and a chance." Some weeks after this trip we attended a school rally at Sevierville for all teachers of thecounty. Here we heard Miss Turner, of Wash ington, who told of the desire of the organization she represented to locate a school in the mountains. I did not think of Ga.tlinburg just then but at noon on my way to the hotel I said, "Let us tell her of Gatlinburg," but we saw Miss Turner and friend talking with some business men so we let it pass. Later in the afternoon I suggested we go meet them and tell about Gatlinburg. We did so. Miss Turner said they would visit the place. You all know the visit was made and its results. After a few years I was permitted to go to Gatlinburg, after school and settlement work was started. It was a very wonderful transformation which I witnessed and I would like to see Gatlinburg as it is now. AUGUST, 1910 BY MAY LANSFIELD KELLER In the summer of 1910 a committee of three, consisting of .Miss Turner, Anna Pettit-Brownell, and the writer, were authorized by the Convention of 1910 held at Swarthmore, Pa., to investigate a site for a Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in the mountains of Eastern 468 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Tennessee. Making Knoxville our headquarters we made trips to various mountain sections and one to Madisonville where a substantial school house had already been erected. At that juncture it was necessary to come to some decision as to our future course, namely whether we should enter a town, take over certain buildings, equip others, and conduct a training school for teachers to be sent back into the mountains of whether the fraternity would be more interested in the actual work of teaching in the heart of the mountains. Pending a decision we determined on further investigation in the neighborhood Our Plant Today, reading from left to right: Stuart Cottage, "Old Cottage" (remodeled) Teachers' Residence-The School building pictured on p. 458 stands to the right of the Residence with a play-ground intervening. of the Great Smokies, but Miss Turner and Mrs. Brownell were both called away,. and I was left to inaugurate a personally conducted tour of my own. . It began with a long distance telephone message from Sevierville summoning me to appear there the next day where a mythical Mr. Drinnen would meet me at the train and drive me up into the mountains. Early the next morning at six-thirty I took my seat in the single passenger coach drawn by a miniature engine, which burned IN RETROSPECT 469 wood not coal, and we puffed, snorted, and panted our way up to Sevierville, the terminal of the toy road. Arrived at the station Mr. Drinnen, then County Superintendent of Schools and one of the firmest friends our school has ever had, met me, drove me to the hotel,, and left me with the assurance that at five the next morning he would call for me and drive me to Gatlinburg where there was a community with-out school facilities and without the prospect of obtaining any. The hotel was-crowded but an obliging daughter of the proprietor gave up A TYPICAL MOUNTAIN HOME her room and also her bed to me, in neither of which was it deemed necessary to make any change in preparation for the new occupant. The weather was warm, so I managed very well reclining at night on the outside of the bed with my own garments for covering. Fussy perhaps but none of you have seen the room or the bed. 'Early the next morning Mr. Drinnen appeared in a small light buggy. His greeting was "I sure am glad you came." On further inquiry I .elicited the information that I had "kind of that healthy 470 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI look," which was necessary to sustain one over seventeen miles of the worst road in Tennessee. At that time there were no bridges, the road to Pigeon Forge had not yet been built, and we forded creeks with the water up to the floor of the buggy. It was an interesting experience, however, and by the time we had run over a yellow dog, which had not energy enough to move, and which its owner "allowed had the hook worm," stopped to talk to three schools in no one of which had the teacher been beyond the fifth grade, but where all the children were pure Americans, intelligent and bright but shy and backward from forces of heredity and environment, I had come to the conclusion that here was a tremendous field for any fraternity with a vision. A FAMOUS Fox HUNTER AND HIS "COMPANION" After driving miles through the bottom lands we came in sight. of the Great Smokies and began to climb steadily. We finally reached Gatlinburg about noon but a different Gatlinburg from that of today. Not a two story house in the whole community, the IN RETROSPECT 471 largest one consisting of two rooms, a living room and bed-room combined, and a small kitchen. The entire population turned out to meet Mr. Drinnen and myself, and those bearded dark-eyed men meant business when they found that I was neither a religious propagandist, a Catholic, nor some one to sell them goods. They did not understand why the fraternity was interested, but if "them women" wanted to give them a school they were mighty sure they would be glad to have it for their children. They were slow to speak in public, and I gained much more information afterward on the porch of the Ogle house, where we were taken for dinner, and where the men congregated to meet "that woman." For the first time I was introduced to the mountain custom of the men sitting down to the table and the women serving, to which however I have since grown accustomed. It was also a little novel to be asked "how old be ye," "be ye married," "why ben't ye married," "ye be old enough," etc., but it was kindly interest. and well meant. After a dinner of "snaps, corn dodger, coffee, tomatoes, and pie" we discussed very earnestly the proposition of a school and if 'ever people wanted an education these did. I could promise nothing, but after good byes were said and Mr. Drinnen had told me on the homeward drive the needs of the community I resolved to send a strong recommendation to the committee that the fraternity locate a school in the mountains and consider the needs of Gatlinburg particularly in seeking a location. To those of THE ARROW readers accustomed to seeing pictures of trim cottages and well clothed children as typical views of the Settlement School and its pupils, I may say that much of these pleasant prospects are due to the earnest work and self sacrifice of our teachers. Others are to tell of later events, but in closing I wish to speak of the marvelous changes I observed on my last visit to the school in the summer of 1918. Mr. Huff was 'running a hotel to which people were coming from Knoxville and elsewhere for the wonderful trout fishing. A little further along was Mr. Maples' house enlarged and with a second story, a new store was going up, fields were being tilled, the people were better dressed and looked as if they had a more active interest in affairs, and I heard rumors of the railroad coming through. Crowning it all were the school buildings with the splendid new up-to-date teachers' cottage with a real bath-room and the Stuart Cottage, both carefully planned by Mrs. Helmick. I lived IN RETROSPECT 4 of the big boys, and I went ,down to Mr. Ogle's store Christmas morning and bought out their supply of ties at cost. You see, we had hoped up to the last minute that the boxes would come. We also got paper sacks at the store and oranges, candy and peanuts. It was not expensive and it was not what we wanted to do, but the children were happy and so it is well. People began to come Christmas morning before we were through our breakfast; in fact, some had breakfast with us, and the children came in. I showed them my things and put them to work filling the sacks and taking baskets over to the school house. We took our window shades down from the cottage and put them up at the school as we wanted to have the candles lighted and it was necessary to give the tree in the day time on account of the small children. Miss Hill was really ill and tired out from being up the night before with the sick, so I took the twenty-five babies in a basket and three under my arm and with the boys and girls with their bundles, we started. I lost my rubbers many times and my good nature was at such low ebb by the time we had made, the crest of the hill that as soon as I got my breath I made a regular suffragette speech. I just announced that I had made my last trip through that mud. Of course I didn't proclaim it from the hill-tops : just said it to the big boys who were helping me array the tree but it didn't take ten minutes for everyone in the "burg" to be discussing it. We got everything on the tree and kept the doors locked while we did it the children were all there and simply expiring to get a peek. The men were just as curious. There were about three hundred people at the affair. They never have family dinners nor ever have Christmas trees at home. But the thing that surprised me most of all was that they know absolutely nothing of the religious idea of Christmas. I had told my room the story of the "Little Boy's Visit to Santa Claus," just from my remembrance of Mr. Wylie's telling it years ago, and they were the best audience I have ever seen. From that time on I had no rest from their entreaties to tell them another story, so the last day of school I had the little people cut out and color Christmas pictures and also took a beautiful picture of the shepherds following the star and tacked it up after explaining to them. I told them the old, old story of Mary and Joseph. Not one of my fifty and more bdys and girls 474 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI knew who Mary was nor had any conception of the beauty of the Christmas from the religious standpoint. It is surprising, as these people are supposed to be religious, if nothing else, and it seems as if the Bible 'stories might have been handed down by word of mouth, if nothing else. After we had everything on the tree I asked Mr. Ephriam Ogle to go for Miss Hill, as I don't believe she ever would have made it through the mud. He hitched up the big mule and brought the lady back in no time, and thankful she was for the transit. The Christmas tree was a huge holly. The children said that they always had holly so I was willing as long as they were doing it for their pleasure and not mine but we had a terrible time making the candles stay on, succeeding after a fashion. I much prefer our own beautiful evergreen myself, although this looked very pretty with ,the colored chains, strings of holly berries and popcorn. We had just a musical program, preceded by a short talk and prayer, and every-thing was lovely until Mr. and Mrs. Santa arrived. You see, we never dreamed that anyone here would carry out our ideas of a Santa Claus, and having it in the daytime, we decided it would be better to let the big boys distribute the presents, but at the very last minute they came to me and asked if I didn't think it would be more fun for the children to have Santa. I was delighted, and told them by all means if there was anyone in the burg who would do it. Imagine my consternation when an old darky and his wife appeared and began the burlesque. Well, we had to laugh and make the best of it but can you imagine that conception of the jolly old saint! They were doing it in all kindness as Mrs. Santa was our trusty youth 'and Santa himself, the young man who had. just been licensed. to preach. When they began making personal remarks we called Mr. Santa over and told him to be brief and asked Charlie Ogle and one of the other big boys to assist us, or we would have been there all night. And so the thing finally ended with the children happy, which is the big thing. We came home and opened our mail, indulged in a Christmas lunch of good things, and went to bed at seven o'clock, so weary that nary a. Christmas dream came.
