        524 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI The woman suffrage movement is one of the great factors in the present stirring in the masses, giving courage to demand a fair portion for labor. Woman 'suffrage is really making an appeal for the universal rights of the human race, and eventually the appeal will awaken both men and women to the fact that they themselves have given up their right to the enjoyment of the fruit of their labor, because they have not used their minds nor thought out their problems. They have always looked for a savior, but they will some day see that they can save themselves, when they use the powers they have in themselves. This government is of the people, by the people and when the people realize this, it will be a government for the people. I was asked to give a talk upon "Women in Business." I have taken this to mean women who occupy positions of recognized authority where their opinions influence the policy of the corporation. I know of two such women. I also know many women who have keen intelligence, cultivation and initiative whose pluck and indomitable determination to succeed have forced their recognition as efficient departmental managers where they must carry out the will .of the general management. In many cases the success of nominal heads of the business is based upon the efficiency of these women. But the two principal barriers, in a business woman's life, are first the stupidity of men who fear to give recognition to a woman's ability just because she is a woman, and second fear of men to test the Golden Rule in business. NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON T HE Pi Beta Phi Settlement School closed its year on the second of April, after eight full months of school. During the entire year there were four teachers. For the first five months we had the only school in the district, teaching the free school, which was supposed to be attended by all children of school age, namely, from eight to sixteen. The state has had a compulsory school law only for two years and unfortunately in Sevier County the law is not enforced, every case which has come up before the court having been thrown out. Therefore with no backing from the county, to compel attendance in practically impossible. However it is gratifying to know that our average attendance, low as it sounds, is higher than any other in the county, with possibly two exceptions, both of those NEWS FROM LITTLE PIGEON 525 schools similar to ours which have been in operation for a number of years. During the fall we had at one time on our roll 130, and that month we had an average attendance of practically 100. That was during September. During October the church here held protracted meetings for two weeks, and the school became badly disorganized, and did not recover fully till after the Christmas holidays. Since Christmas we have had on our roll 100 different names, with an average attendance during the first two months of 80 and during the last month of 60. The last low average is due to the fact that all the older ones usually drop out of school when warm weather begins in order to help in preparing for sowing seed. Our attendance kept up unusually well, none from our ninth grade dropping out, and only three from the seventh and eigth. The sixth grade suffered badly, made up, as it is, of "left overs" who are in general put there because they are too old to be put lower down, and with whom we do work according to their needs and deficiencies. During the year we have had on the roll 158, of whom 75 were girls and 83 were boys. They are divided as follows: ninth grade, 4 boys; seventh and eighth grades, 15 6 boys and 9 girls; fifth and sixth grades, 16--14 boys and 2 girls; fourth grade, 24 11 boys and 13 girls; third grade, 34 19 boys and 15 girls; second grade, 28 11 boys and 17 girls ; first grade 37 17 boys and 20 girls. Of this entire number 9 were over 21 at the end of the year, the oldest being about 30. Three of those who were in our ninth grade during the latter part of the year and one from the eighth grade are planning to take the teachers' examination and will teach next year, provided they get certificates. The most important thing, perhaps, which has been accomplished in school work this year is the grading of the school. Now the larger part of the school is well graded, each person doing approximately what his ability requires. This is true approximately for the first four grades, though there are still some exceptions. Of course when a girl of fourteen enters who can scarcely read at all, we do the best we can for her and put her in the third grade and try to give her individual attention, instead of putting her in the primer. But there are few such instances at present. We had one man nearly thirty enter, who could scarcely read. During the two months that he stayed in school he made considerable progress. The most notable progress made is that of a young man now eighteen. H'e entered school a year 526 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI ago last January. Before that he had spent all his time hunting, loafed around the stores in his overalls, and could scarcely read at all and could not write so one could read his name. He is now doing straight sixth grade work, passed a test in the advanced geography with a grade of over 80, joined the church last fall, and is as courteous a young gentleman as one would care to meet. The people here gauge our progress by the advancement in arithmetic and reading, and by ability to spell. To know the meaning of words is entirely superfluous. We have emphasized the -meaning and the use of words, and have aroused a healthy desire to be able to use every word spelled. This is one of the things in which th;S year has shown marked progress. Miss Young has proved herself most skillful in getting the children to sing ; and the primary grades this year have learned over forty new songs. Their singing has become noted through this section and is one of the things most remarked on by the people. The third and fourth grades have also learned many pieces, but they had become so thoroughly steeped in the idea that the beauty of singing depends on the volume of the sound that their work is not so satisfactory from the standpoint of the music teacher. There have been two classes in cooking and two classes in sewing. The older girls have made princess slips, some of them have made either dresses or shirt waists, they have learned to make button holes, and several have learned to crochet and to embroider. Many of them did hemstitching for Christmas presents. This year several of the girls have tried at home, things they have learned in cooking class. Last year it was hard to induce them to try new things. In permanent improvements to the property, we have made considerable progress. A new orchard of three dozen trees has been started; two currant bushes have been set out; fifteen rhubarb roots planted; a model hen house built and an eighth acre fenced in for a poultry yard; a board walk laid between the schoolhouse and the cottage; a baseball field cleaned and leveled; the old barn torn down; basketball posts made; a bridge built across Bearskins ;. about two dozen ornamental shrubs and rosebushes set out; a strawberry bed started; a new garden fenced in; all this besides the finishing and furnishing of the new building. A large number of good books have been added to the library, so that we now have approximately five hundred books, not counting paper covered classics for use in reading WHAT A FRATERNITY GIRL THINKS 527 classes. Of course many of these books are old text books sent in the boxes, but most of these have proved valuable as reference books where none others are available. The sentiment of the county toward the school is one of our strongest assets. Whereas there is still some strong prejudice against us here in the neighborhood, due largely to jealousy on the part of some who are afraid their own people will be cheated out of a job of teaching because "we foreigners" come in, and to fear on the part of some of the older ones who still suspect that we may be some different religious denomination coming to start a rival church, yet outside of this immediate vicinity everyone is our friend. The business men of the county seat are loud in the praise of the work done, and the greater part of the people here are our warm friends. The school is on a firmer basis than at any previous time in its history, and the prospects are bright for a more successful school during the coming year than during the past. MARY O. POLLARD, Head Resident. WHAT A FRATERNITY GIRL THINKS (This discussion commenced in the March number is concluded in this issue. The chapters were told to write frankly, with the assurance that material too intimate for publication would be seen only by members of the Grand Council. A number of the contributions which have not been selected for publication have been found of use in preparing the topics for convention discussions.) Having the convention on the Pacific Coast this year means more to the western chapters than any chapter in the East can possibly A Word realize. It is true that we seem to be separated from the other provinces by an undefinable barrier but it From a Hostess is an inexcusable barrier and one which I am sure will drop after next summer's season of getting acquainted and knowing what we are really like out here. We chapters have always felt that we have had no opportunity to become acquainted with our Grand Officers, for they rarely travel this far West, but now convention will give us this chance and we are surely going to make the most of it.
