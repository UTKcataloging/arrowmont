Such a statement should reveal the re-turns on the long-term investment and also analyse the prospects for the future. This must include more than statistics for there are human values that lie behind the facts. It is impossible to estimate the influence of the Settlement School on the lives of thousands. This diversified pro-gram has placed emphasis on education, health, and the preservation and promotion of crafts. The wisdom of this practice, during the 46 years, has been borne out in the passing of time. This report will show the progress made in the various fields during the 1957-58 year. Education Rewarding dividends have come from Pi Beta Phi's original investment in education, at the time when a narrow wagon trail was the only entrance to Gatlinburg and the hamlet numbered 6 houses, a blacksmith shop, and the Baptist Church. People settled near the school so that their children could profit by education, and because of Pi Phi, a town grew. The school still bears the name of Pi Beta Phi although the County maintains it. At no time has Sevier County been able to carry on an adequate school program without state aid; so again this year Pi Phi augmented the basic minimum curriculum with teachers for Physical Education and Health, Arts and Crafts, Wood-working and Music. Exceptionally fine instructors were secured and Mrs. Mueller, Director of Settlement School, continued to serve in an advisory capacity with the school principal and the County Board of Education. Due to the high standards and persistent efforts of Mr. Carl Lewelling, the principal, the school once again received an "A" rating. There is more than one way in which to invest in education at Settlement School. The most gratifying returns have come from the dormitory program for mountain young people who live too far from a high school to travel daily by school bus. The fall of 1957 found 17 boys and girls registered for a place in the dormitories. Supervised by Mrs. Mueller and Mrs. Ruth Spelman the House Mother, the children worked for a certain number of hours, in addition to the monthly $5.00 payment, for the privilege of living in the dorm. The training received from work experience offered an extra dividend in addition to the class-room instruction. Study tables were established for those coming from rural schools. The Brendel scholarship legacy made it possible to secure remedial reading for a freshman and also to award a scholarship to an outstanding dorm girl whose family, because of illness, found it difficult to keep two children in school. The Director always found time to advise when asked and attempted to help the individuals to find work or to solve a personal problem. She drove the children to some of the high school football and basketball games and planned seasonal parties with the assistance of committees from the young people. This coming year, the Director will have the co-operation of her new Assistant, Sharon Dexter, Illinois Zeta, and so the dorm program will continue to make an impression on the lives of the mountain young people. It is wonderful to have a young Pi Phi on the staff. Besides, character-building is done by piecework and that requires a full staff. It was possible to give one of the dorm girls, who graduated this May, a scholarship for advanced study from the Alspaugh Scholarship. Were it possible to tell of the various children, Pi Phi would be proud of her foresight in investing in these young people. Each member should realize and beglad that every Settlement School gift not only contributes to the maintenance of staff and buildings, but also under-writes the opportunity for a high school education for those who otherwise might not have the chance. The staff house lodged the resident staff and furnished reasonable, pleasant living for out-of-town teachers. This was another way Pi Phi furthered education for, with the low salary scale for Tennessee teachers, there is difficulty in attracting and holding qualified teachers. In the summer, the staff of the Summer Craft Workshop was housed in this building while the entire student body ate in the large dining-room. The fourth type of investment in the educational field, the Summer Craft Workshop, is one that made use of the plant in the summer. The dormitories, which housed the mountain young people in winter, and the classrooms were taken over by adults from all over the U.S.A. and abroad. The Workshop, jointly sponsored by Pi Beta Phi and the University of Tennessee, long ago passed the experimental stage. The 14th annual Workshop was noteworthy for enthusiasm and exceptionally fine work. After setting up and getting the Workshop off to a good start, Marion Heard turned it over to her co-director, Jane Glass. Marion left to be the instructor for the second Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennessee Foreign Study Craft Tour. The Staff of the College of Home Economics at UT, as usual, gave excellent co-operation. Dean Jessie Harris, whose valuable counsel is responsible for much of the success of the project, retires this fall. Words are inadequate to express the fraternity's appreciation for the assistance of this capable Pi Phi. It is a comfort to know that the Settlement School Committee will work with Acting Dean Ida Anders who is a loyal Pi Phi, well-informed concerning the Workshop. Already there are significant reasons indicating the 1959 Workshop should be much larger. First, the Workshop session will start a week later; those who found this year's early beginning date inconvenient, will be pleased. There will be neither a Pi Phi Convention nor Foreign Study Craft Tour to offer a counter-attraction. The deciding factor for many will be the need tax ruling which allows deduction for expenditures made for education undertaken primarily for the maintaining or improving of skills required in the individual's employment, trade or business. While this will not apply to those in pursuit of a hobby or the community volunteer, it will encourage producing artists, teachers, physiotherapists, and welfare workers to seek additional skills, provided that living expenses and tuition are in line. One hurdle to overcome is the inadequate housing plan. The temporary plan of 14 years' standing, which requires the conversion of the 42 year old grade school building into a dormitory, presents almost insurmountable difficulties. In spite of herculean efforts on the part of the staff, the results are not up to Pi Phi standards. The Southern Highland Guild held a short Weaving Workshop at Settlement School just before the opening of the Summer Craft Workshop. The resident staff proved most efficient in serving the meals with the help of several dorm girls. This challenges the Committee to make even greater use of the facilities at Settlement School and to meet important, present day opportunities for service. Pi Phi came to Gatlinburg to bring educational opportunities but found the native crafts which it could help the mountain people share with the rest of the world. It is thrilling to dream of short Workshops, national in scope, for occupational therapists, craft instructors for crippled children and many others who would find it pleasant in the Smokies in the spring, late summer and early fall. Recently an edu 53 54 THE ARROW OF P1 BETA PHI cator confronted us with a new trend. Just as the seniors of Pi Beta Phi school take a trip to Washington each spring, students and teachers in large cities need to come to such a place as the Smokies. They could be brought into the area for several days in workshops to study early American life, Indian life and lore, and wild life and nature study. What a chance to pioneer again in Gatlinburg! There is no use to go back to seek a lost opportunity; someone else has found it. As mentioned in the 1956 report, the red barn strategically located near the staff house dining-room, could have a future. This could be the answer to the housing problem and greater use of the Settlement. Well, one, can dream! Here is a prospect for the future advancement of education, health and crafts to which we, are committed at Settlement School. Health Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers is now the Pi Phi nurse in more than one way. For over 22 years she has been in charge of the Jennie Nicol Memorial Health Center, and at the Swampscott 'Convention, she was initiated into Pi Beta Phi. In the 38 years since the fraternity established the health service, Gatlinburg has changed from a sleepy little village. The health service has changed, too, for the policy has always been to meet the needs of the community and area whenever possible. Early in the history of the Health Center, the diseases which were then prevalent, were attacked and soon the community was almost 'free of hookworm, typhoid and diphtheria. Now 93% of the Pi Beta Phi school children have had all 3 Salk inoculations; Health Center has given nearly 3000 doses. Classes in bed-side care and health education steadily reduce the demands on the community nursing service; however there is in-creased pressure for better instruction, for more protection from accident and disease, and early recognition of correctable defects. Marjorie visited the one remaining rural school in the Gatlinburg area and gave the usual examinations and inoculations. Her article in the Summer ARROW gave a glimpse of that part of her work. Maternal and infant welfare continued to be an important phase of the health service. Every Friday was set aside 'for the well baby clinic. Other clinics were carefully planned from time to time. Detailed records were filed for future reference. Nurse Marjorie continued to be as active as time permitted in various community activities such as Community Chest, Civil Defense, Social Service, Committees of the Church, and Scout Counciling. The nurse believes community service is her mission in life. SUMMARY OF WORK Field visits 526 Office calls 3925 Service given 3286 Small pox vaccinations 116 Total typhoid inoculations 546 Completed typhoid series and boosters 442 Total triple vaccine inoculations 293 Completed typhoid series and boosters 151 Salk vaccine inoculations 509 Therapeutic inoculations 270 Health talks 161 Teacher-Nurse conferences 156 Examinations and inspections 3079 Chest X-Rays 1263 The returns on an investment in health services can scarcely be reckoned. Better a fence at the edge of the precipice than a hospital at the foot. Crafts One of the important "securities" in the Settlement School investment portfolio is the Arrowcraft project development. Native crafts were fast dying out when Pi Phi introduced the cottage crafts to the mountain folks who needed this economic security. In elevating the traditional crafts to an art, Pi Phi has developed an increased self-respect among the mountain craftsmen and a deeper appreciation of their heritage from the past. The Settlement School has been instrumental in making Gatlinburg a major craft center and leading area for hand weaving in the country. Thus Pi Phi continues to contribute to the American culture. Winogene Redding returned to assume the duties of Weaving Supervisor and Designer. Gene was the first De-signer and even helped to name the project "Arrowcraft." A report of her years at Settlement School reads like a pioneer story. Gene had 54 of the best weavers busy this winter and called on more when the designs were ready for quantity production in anticipation of the fall sales. About 14 newly designed articles were ready for Convention and the delegates were most complimentary in their comments. Our former Designer, Mrs. Tina McMorran, dropped in at Arrowcraft now and then during the coffee break and kept up her contacts with the staff at Guild meetings. Elizabeth Rue, the friendly Arrowcraft Manager, met at Convention many of the officers from the 234 clubs which ordered from Arrowcraft Shop. This was a happy experience for these clubs furnish the principal markets for the mountain handcrafts. The tourist trade at Gatlinburg continued as visitors came to the Smokies in the fall, spring and summer months. The Arrowcraft Shop remained open at night during the summer tourist season. Most Pi Phis came to the Shop when in the Burg and Mrs. Rue was pleased to meet them when possible; however she was always ready to put them in touch with Mrs. Mueller, the Director, who could arrange a tour of the grounds. The local mountain girls served in the shop most capably. Arrowcraft had an exhibit at the Craftsman's Fair at Asheville. Next year the Fair will return to Gatlinburg. The newly revised Manual for Chapter and Club Settlement will be ready for fall and each chairman is urged to become familiar with the contents. There will be some new items on the Arrowcraft price list. Settlement School note paper with etchings of Health Center and Arrowcraft Shop will sell at ten for 5(4. An attractive addition to the Arrowcraft sales will be blue sacks imprinted in wine with the Arrowcraft trademark. These will come in three sizes. The Cook Books were ready in November; in less than six months 10,000 copies were sold. The second edition is ready for shipment and with a systematic plan of contacting the membership, clubs should have even larger sales of the book. Mrs. Emily Cantwell, the new Arrowcraft bookkeeper, reported more clubs paid by invoice. It is obvious the reason this request was made last year. Arrowcraft must meet the monthly bills and if all waited until May 31 to settle their accounts, this would be impossible. There are other ways in which clubs can help. Care should be taken not to over-order since this takes stock from other clubs when needed and leaves Arrowcraft in difficulty when re-turned after the holidays. Also, clubs should note there are some articles which cannot be returned. Neither can the club order be filled and mailed to various addresses. This demands too much time from the girls during the rush period and requires too much in the way of shipping sup-plies. Pi Phi owes a debt of gratitude to the clubs which had the courage to step forward and do their best. The following 22 clubs deserve special mention for these bought and paid for at least $1000 worth of Arrowcraft during the past fiscal year. Northern New Jersey.$2809.97 Kansas City, Mo $1287.58 Champaign-Urbana 2601.59 Dallas 1269.98 Houston 2400.09 Milwaukee 1167.44 Oklahoma City 2171.24 Arlington Heights 1156.00 Pasadena 2065.52 Cleveland East 1149.90 Denver 2014.10 Palo Alto 1105.52 Pittsburgh 1996.43 Fayetteville 1105.43 Tulsa 1909.34 Topeka 1079.73 Lincoln 1482.38 Portland, Ore 1066.23 Ames 1352.17 Madison 1055.39 South Bend 1351.63 Albuquerque 1015.68 The efforts of the other 212 clubs contributed to the success of Arrowcraft in securing a market for the mountain handcrafts. During the last 5 years, Pi Phi has paid THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 55 $276,556.24 to Craftsmen. One of life's greatest dividends is the feeling we have helped others in some way. When we sell Arrowcraft, we sell quality. Others may imitate but none duplicate! Facts and Figures All investments require money. It is gratifying to record that approximately 50 groups sizably increased their annual gifts to the Settlement School. This was a step towards overcoming inflation. Someone has said inflation is the art of cutting a dollar bill in half without touching the paper. Recent figures state that $1 out of 5 is eaten up by inflation. This means that what $4 bought 10 years ago, now costs $5. This also means that group gifts, which this year were the same as that given a decade ago, did not accomplish as much at Settlement School. The Committee gratefully received gifts for Settlement School from 102 chapters; this means there was only one which did not respond. Surely this year the chapters can be 100% which will be an achievement. The Clubs in the following Provinces were 100% in support of the national philanthropy: Beta Eta Mu Gamma Theta Xi Epsilon Lambda Pi The active chapters invested $2562.47 this year in Settlement School. This was an increase of $256.98 over the previous year. The alumnae clubs added $9359.45 which was a gain of $505.28. Texas Beta joined the ranks of chapters sending $100 or more; the other three have been regular members of the $100 club. Texas I' $150.00 Texas A $100.00 Texas B $100.00 Missouri B $100.00 The following 10 clubs invested $150 or more during 1957-58; those marked (*) made substantial increases over the previous year. St. Louis $800.00 *Pasadena $350.00 Cleveland East 510.00 Philadelphia 235.00 Kansas City, Mo 500.00 Milwaukee 225.00 *North Shore, Ill 500.00 Indianapolis 220.00 *Los Angeles 400.00 Denver, Sr 150.00 The above sums were increased by $9,048.18 from the Magazine Agency. This was $94.57 less. Elsewhere is printed the report which will give proper recognition to the faithful chairmen. Well executed plans could bring bigger returns next year. Many sent Christmas gifts to the School and Health Center. Boxes of good clothing were received and distributed as the need arose. At Convention $72.50 was collected for books in the Grace Coolidge Library at Settlement School, This gift was in memory of. Mrs. Coolidge who lived inMassachusetts and had served as a Province officer. Mrs. Mueller will supervise the selection of the needed books. More Pi Phis are realizing that it is appropriate to send gifts to the Settlement School treasurer in memory of friends who were members of the fraternity. Upon receipt of the contribution to the Memorial Fund, a suitable card is sent to the family. This fund was spent many times over, that is, in the minds of the Committee. A real attempt is made to choose very special purchases with this money and since there are so many places to use it, careful thought must be used. Another deep freeze would be a useful addition since the garden and chickens soon fill the one at Staff House. A station wagon could well replace the 1951 car; however there are some items high up on the Wishing List which require that the Fund should grow. Legacies have not been stressed too much in recent years; however to remember Settlement School in a will is one way to invest in the future. These gifts have been used for major improvements or building. This year the bequest from the Marian Stoner Huey estate was received and it is hoped that too much time will not elapse before the Joanna King Hempsted estate can be settled. A legal formwill appear in the ARROW as a reminder of this opportunity to invest in a living memorial. The above figures reveal vast investments of time, talents, and efforts on the part of many members in order to give substantial support to Settlement School. In spite of the generous gifts sent by a number of loyal groups, it should be called to attention that approXimately $30,000 in discounts went INTO the club treasuries from Arrowcraft sales and that little over $9,000 was sent FROM the clubs to support Settlement School. It would appear that instead of supporting Settlement School, some clubs were counting on the Settlement School products to support the local club and its projects. This is an arresting thought. As Lois Finger, the new chairman for Settlement School Publicity, stated so well in the fall letter to Pi Phi groups: "When you contribute to Settlement School, you do not contribute to Arrowcraft. Settlement School contributions go to maintain the buildings and grounds; to pay the salaries of our maintenance people, our teachers, and our staff; and to support the Health Center. You contribute to Arrowcraft, and so to the welfare of the mountain people, when you buy and sell Arrowcraft articles. When you hold Arrow-craft sales and contribute the net profits of that sale, you are contributing to ALL of the work at Gatlinburg." Unexpected demands were made on the Settlement School funds. This winter, Gatlinburg endured the longest and coldest period it has experienced in years. This required extra fuel and repair of pipes which burst after 30 years of service. At the end of the fiscal year, a water heater had to be replaced before Summer Workshop. Teachers' Cottage must be painted for the first time in six years. From now on, it would seem wise to paint one of the buildings each year. Fortunately paint holds up well in the Burg. Committee agreed some time ago it would never again tax the purse by painting everything at once. It is evident Committee must face surprises as well as inflation. Louise Dobler retired from the Committee after serving a term of 5 years as Publicity Chairman. She will be missed in many ways but one thing sure, she will be working for Settlement School and Arrowcraft in Everett, Washington. Smart program chairmen in that area should invite her to present their Settlement School program. Helen Russell joined the Committee to serve as Chairman of Slide Distribution. Helen brings a fine background of fraternity service as a former Province officer and member of the Committee on Chaperons. Future The true test of successful investing is achievement over a period long enough to include varied experiences and conditions. Settlement School has stood the test of time. New and intriguing opportunities constantly come to Pi Phi. The Chamber of Commerce in Gatlinburg, recognizing the ability of the Director of the Settlement School, elected her to be the president of that important civic organization. In addition to her strenuous schedule at Settlement School, Marion found time to participate in the Garden Club, PTA and various other groups. It is a challenge to realize that 5 girls, who wished to be in the dorm next year, must be refused. . . . The Arrow-craft "cottage industry" can demonstrate even more effectively to foreign visitors what can be done to help people help themselves. . . The same improved housing facilities for Workshop could afford greater use in the educational craft program. . . . Pi Phi must face the fact that its influence through this channel is making a significant contribution to American culture and that its influence is ever expanding. Future plans must be flexible and forward looking to make the best use of the Settlement School for education, health service and crafts. Your Settlement School Committee appreciates the trust you place in us. We assure you of our sincere belief in the soundness of your investment and foresee many opportunities for increased dividends.

The vast part of the Smokies lies within an easy day's drive of more than half of the nation's population. Actually, Gatlinburg is a two-mile long village of less than two thousand population at the junction of highways 73 and 441. These high-ways lead to: Loafing amid mountain splendor Fishing in crystal clear streams Hiking to skyline lookout points Trail riding to unopened valleys Gatlinburg And SETTLEMENT SCHOOL. Gatlinburg is a tourist town with 'approximately ninety motels and four hotels; a convention town with an auditorium with seating capacity of two thousand. The area has long been recognized for its many crafts. Settlement School is in the heart of Gatlinburg at the junction of the two highways. Even though we mingle with the towns-people, much of our activity is with the rural folks. This is also a land of superlatives with its lush vegetation and natural beauty. The place where we live is easy enough to find yes, easy to find, but difficult to forget! Here one finds the old, the new! Gatlinburg area is a combination of yesterday and today. We have neon signs, swimming pools, modern motels and hotels, many shops in the burg; and not too distant there are waterfalls, swimming holes, looms and log cabins. Pi Beta Phi memorial to our Founders is in the midst of such an area. It is a challenge to Pi Beta Phi to meet these changes as they arise. We trust that these changes from yesterday to to-morrow will be progressive. Due to all these attractions, there are many visitors, many of whom are Pi Phis. If you ever come this way, the Settlement School WELCOME MAT is out to each of you. Arrowcraft Coming in on either highway one soon sees the Arrow-craft Shop. Undoubtedly this is our largest contact with Pi Beta Phis everywhere. Manager Elizabeth Rue greets folks whenever possible. Pi Phis can be proud of the splendid record of their Alumni Clubs the nucleus of Arrowcraft business. With the many successful sales con-ducted by our Settlement School chairmen and helpers their slogan could be "the reward of a thing well done is to have done it !" North, South, East, and West you have done it! Many thanks to each of you. The new price lists will picture many of the new articles. Chairmen will doubtless have trouble choosing there is such a large variety. The Cookbooks have sold well, being in the second printing (10,000 each printing) in less than a year. Several changes in personnel were made at Arrowcraft Gene Redding returned as designer, having been away since 1945. As a consequence there are many new designs. Gene succeeded Tina McMorran who is now retired and free-lancing in her home with weaving specialties. Edna Cook, who served as salesgirl or assistant to the weaving designer for ten years, was married and lives in Detroit. Faye Cook succeeds her sister. Emily Cantwell is now bookkeeper, succeeding Eunice Cole. Nella Cook Hill, Nadine Grooms, Charlotte Moyer, and Susie Maples complete the staff. Mrs. McCutchan continues to sell Arrowcraft in the Mountain View lobby. Health Center Perhaps the biggest event at Health Center was the initiation of our nurse Marjorie Chalmers at Convention. We are happy to have Marjorie wearing the Arrow. To summarize her work one might say it is preventive a gradual change from years past. This includes the maternaland infant clinics, preschool clinic, T.B. x-ray clinic, physical examinations and inspections in all the rooms, follow-ups when necessary, and inoculations. Community Projects We believe that good public relations make for better community service and community service is one of our missions in life. Several staff members participate in one or more projects, among them Community Chest, Civil Defense, Committees of the churches, Scout counciling, Chamber of Commerce president, P.T.A., and Garden Club vice-president. Dormitories The dormitory part of our program is perhaps the most challenging activity at Settlement School because of its far-reaching scope. Many of the results are immeasurable. Fifteen children (eight boys, seven girls) completed the school year in our dormitory. Several were good students, several very poor. Naturally, I am concerned about the latter. A trade school might be the answer. Not having that, it is difficult to convince them that an education is important. Three dormitory girls made Beta Club, one boy and one girl were on Student Council, and three were on the football squad. One girl paid for music lessons by doing extra chores. A dormitory Halloween party with guests, a Christmas party with gift exchange, Valentine party, Class party, and picnic were the larger events during the year. There was evidence of dormitory "spirit." Two girls came back during the summer to chat. Linda said "'Gee, I sure do miss this place !" The other replied "Me, too." Dwight has lived in our dormitory three years, going to Pi Beta Phi high school. His home is twelve miles out in Wear's Valley. Dwight loves the outdoors, and is a dreamer, a young poet. When asked what he was doing on his vacation, he replied, "just settin'." I know he would "just set" as much as possible. The following is an ex-ample of his dreaming (he says he wrote this in algebra class) : THE WANDERER I walk this winding, upward path That few human feet have trod, Wonderous beauty all around, Created by the hand of God. And as, alone, I walk along I think of things I've left behind And how the Lord looks down on me By giving me this peace of mind. Across the way the sun now shines, Across the glen a bird now sings ; Through the tall green hickory trees A frisky little squirrel swings. The day grows older with each passing hour, The sun climbs higher, so do I ; To the top of the towering peak I climb, To the top of the tower, into the sky. From this point I look about And wonder more upon the sight; Far out across the tree-clad hills A great bald eagle makes his flight ; To the west and north is a man-scarred land With cities, factories, smoke, and noise; To the south and east lies God's great land, Wild with freedom, love, and joys. I may wander far and near But when my heart beat cloth cease, 'Tis here I want my body laid To rest in quiet, solemn peace. -DWIGHT DAVENPORT One day each week two music teachers give private piano lessons in Teachers and Stuart dormitories thus adding a bit of culture to our program. School Again Pi Beta Phi school was rated grade "A" for the THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 61 year. There are approximately one hundred seventy-five high school students with a graduating class of forty. Pi Beta Phi provided the Arts and Crafts, Woodcraft (two classes), Music, Physical Education, and Health Center with a full-time nurse. Hiring the Physical Education instructor is to be discontinued this year '58-'59. Tennessee schools rate very low in the nation, and our Sevier County very low in the state. So, there is still much room for improvement. The much-needed new lunch room has been added to the County gymnasium and is to be ready for school in September. Anna Belle Lee, who graduated from the University of Tennessee in June, is to teach Arts and Crafts for '58-'59. Mrs. Walter Enlow is to teach Music, and Carl Huskey teaches Woodcraft. One rural school, The Glades, is the only one-room school in our twelve mile area. Gradually they are disappearing; however, there are still eleven in the county. Farm To call our gardening and chicken-raising a farm is a misnomer. Actually much of our acreage is not tillable. There is considerable wooded land. Most of the garden produce finds its way to our table, directly or via the freezer. Richard Watson has been with us about eight years ,as farmer. His avocation is the ministry. Baptist, of course! Maintenance This could well be termed the most important department of all. There is much to maintain 78 acres, 12 buildings. Honestly, there is hardly a day that there is not some repair, somewhere. Having the second highest rainfall in the United States, there is much water damage. Much of the repair is negative. If it were not done, the result would be "sorry." Orlie Watson takes pride in the various lines of duty through his thirty years at Settlement School. He is carpenter, plumber, janitor, painter all in one day. Neal works with Orlie wherever duty calls. He, too, could be called "handyman." Orlie and Neal ship the many cartons of express from Arrowcraft to our Clubs. Weather never interferes. Pi Beta Phi University of Tennessee Workshop Marian Heard served in setting up Workshop, then pre-pared for leading the Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennessee Craft Tour to Europe for six weeks. Jane Glass continued to guide Workshop through its fourteenth season. Each year I am amazed at the individuals coming from all walks of life and various ages for a common purpose to study crafts. Each year the results seem to exceed the previous year in workmanship. Beginners surprise themselves and usually are quite proud of their work. There are several reasons why it is desirable to replace the temporary, make-shift dormitory in the old white school building. Our sturdy red barn could be converted to fill this need. This improvement for Settlement School would have untold possibilities with other projects, both in housing and workshops with multiple-purpose rooms. This could be kept on an educational level thus maintaining the goal of our Founders. Pi Beta Phis everywhere should be proud of this evidence here at Settlement School evidence of many hours and years of tireless and devoted effort of many of their members. Staff Starting my fifth year as Settlement School director I actually have a "queer" feeling. Why? Because for thefirst time I have a complete staff at the beginning of school. Even though several have years of service to their credit, usually someone is making or about to make a change. Sharon Dexter, Illinois Zeta, has recently come to serve as assistant to the director. I am sure Sharon will become very valuable to Settlement School. Ruth Shantz Spelman, Illinois Epsilon, has been with us a year as housemother, literally filling a need with the dormitory children. Gene Redding's return as designer at Arrowcraft is a homecoming because she was here sixteen out of twenty years-1925-1945. Susie Maples assists Gene Redding in the weaving department in addition to part-time selling at Arrowcraft. Mrs. Lela Adams is beginning her sixth year as cook for staff. She not only cooks, but supervises the deep freeze, canning and jelly making. Something New In June the Southern Highland Guild sponsored a three-day weaving workshop at our school. We were happy to serve as hosts for this educational project of the Guild. Approximately sixty attended. The Guild is planning future workshops in other crafts. For the first time in eight years the Southern Highland Guild Fair is to be in Gatlinburg in 1959. This is an event that many follow. If you have never been to the Craftsman's Fair, that would be a wonderful opportunity to see craftsmen at work, and to buy choice pieces. Experts in over forty crafts bring their displays and sales during the five-day period in late July. Of course, our, Arrowcraft shop sells and exhibits. Theatres Good entertainment for the tourists was available during the summer. Mr. John Richards brought his company from the New York American Academy of Dramatic Art for the twelfth season. The high school auditorium has been the location of this so-called Gateway Theatre. As usual a repertory of five plays was offered "Bus Stop," "Street Car Named Desire," "Come Back Little Sheba," "Out-ward Bound," "Mouse Trap." The Old Timers met again for their annual Harp Singing and celebration the last Saturday in June. "Chucky Jack" depicting the early history of Tennessee completed its third season as an outdoor pageant in a natural setting four miles east of Gatlinburg. Gifts Words are inadequate to express our appreciation of the many gifts to Settlement School gifts for the dormitories, Health Center, Christmas, clothing and books. All these gifts have been listed elsewhere. Again, I wish to extend our appreciation to each donor. It is heartening to receive them. When these gifts from everywhere arrive one realizes the magnitude of this project of Pi Beta Phi. Thank you To Grand Council, to Settlement School Committee, to Province Officers, to the many Pi Phis everywhere I extend a great big THANK YOU for your cooperation in helping to make this project something of which our Founders would be proud. Our slogan might be: "There is hope for the future And help in the past But for WORK There is only TODAY" Respectfully submitted, MARION W. MUELLER, Director Pi Beta Phi Settlement School

        54 THE ARROW OF P1 BETA PHI cator confronted us with a new trend. Just as the seniors of Pi Beta Phi school take a trip to Washington each spring, students and teachers in large cities need to come to such a place as the Smokies. They could be brought into the area for several days in workshops to study early American life, Indian life and lore, and wild life and nature study. What a chance to pioneer again in Gatlinburg! There is no use to go back to seek a lost opportunity; someone else has found it. As mentioned in the 1956 report, the red barn strategically located near the staff house dining-room, could have a future. This could be the answer to the housing problem and greater use of the Settlement. Well, one, can dream! Here is a prospect for the future advancement of education, health and crafts to which we, are committed at Settlement School. Health Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers is now the Pi Phi nurse in more than one way. For over 22 years she has been in charge of the Jennie Nicol Memorial Health Center, and at the Swampscott 'Convention, she was initiated into Pi Beta Phi. In the 38 years since the fraternity established the health service, Gatlinburg has changed from a sleepy little village. The health service has changed, too, for the policy has always been to meet the needs of the community and area whenever possible. Early in the history of the Health Center, the diseases which were then prevalent, were attacked and soon the community was almost 'free of hookworm, typhoid and diphtheria. Now 93% of the Pi Beta Phi school children have had all 3 Salk inoculations; Health Center has given nearly 3000 doses. Classes in bed-side care and health education steadily reduce the demands on the community nursing service; however there is in-creased pressure for better instruction, for more protection from accident and disease, and early recognition of correctable defects. Marjorie visited the one remaining rural school in the Gatlinburg area and gave the usual examinations and inoculations. Her article in the Summer ARROW gave a glimpse of that part of her work. Maternal and infant welfare continued to be an important phase of the health service. Every Friday was set aside 'for the well baby clinic. Other clinics were carefully planned from time to time. Detailed records were filed for future reference. Nurse Marjorie continued to be as active as time permitted in various community activities such as Community Chest, Civil Defense, Social Service, Committees of the Church, and Scout Counciling. The nurse believes community service is her mission in life. SUMMARY OF WORK Field visits 526 Office calls 3925 Service given 3286 Small pox vaccinations 116 Total typhoid inoculations 546 Completed typhoid series and boosters 442 Total triple vaccine inoculations 293 Completed typhoid series and boosters 151 Salk vaccine inoculations 509 Therapeutic inoculations 270 Health talks 161 Teacher-Nurse conferences 156 Examinations and inspections 3079 Chest X-Rays 1263 The returns on an investment in health services can scarcely be reckoned. Better a fence at the edge of the precipice than a hospital at the foot. Crafts One of the important "securities" in the Settlement School investment portfolio is the Arrowcraft project development. Native crafts were fast dying out when Pi Phi introduced the cottage crafts to the mountain folks who needed this economic security. In elevating the traditional crafts to an art, Pi Phi has developed an increased self-respect among the mountain craftsmen and a deeper appreciation of their heritage from the past. The Settlement School has been instrumental in making Gatlinburg a major craft center and leading area for hand weaving in the country. Thus Pi Phi continues to contribute to the American culture. Winogene Redding returned to assume the duties of Weaving Supervisor and Designer. Gene was the first De-signer and even helped to name the project "Arrowcraft." A report of her years at Settlement School reads like a pioneer story. Gene had 54 of the best weavers busy this winter and called on more when the designs were ready for quantity production in anticipation of the fall sales. About 14 newly designed articles were ready for Convention and the delegates were most complimentary in their comments. Our former Designer, Mrs. Tina McMorran, dropped in at Arrowcraft now and then during the coffee break and kept up her contacts with the staff at Guild meetings. Elizabeth Rue, the friendly Arrowcraft Manager, met at Convention many of the officers from the 234 clubs which ordered from Arrowcraft Shop. This was a happy experience for these clubs furnish the principal markets for the mountain handcrafts. The tourist trade at Gatlinburg continued as visitors came to the Smokies in the fall, spring and summer months. The Arrowcraft Shop remained open at night during the summer tourist season. Most Pi Phis came to the Shop when in the Burg and Mrs. Rue was pleased to meet them when possible; however she was always ready to put them in touch with Mrs. Mueller, the Director, who could arrange a tour of the grounds. The local mountain girls served in the shop most capably. Arrowcraft had an exhibit at the Craftsman's Fair at Asheville. Next year the Fair will return to Gatlinburg. The newly revised Manual for Chapter and Club Settlement will be ready for fall and each chairman is urged to become familiar with the contents. There will be some new items on the Arrowcraft price list. Settlement School note paper with etchings of Health Center and Arrowcraft Shop will sell at ten for 5(4. An attractive addition to the Arrowcraft sales will be blue sacks imprinted in wine with the Arrowcraft trademark. These will come in three sizes. The Cook Books were ready in November; in less than six months 10,000 copies were sold. The second edition is ready for shipment and with a systematic plan of contacting the membership, clubs should have even larger sales of the book. Mrs. Emily Cantwell, the new Arrowcraft bookkeeper, reported more clubs paid by invoice. It is obvious the reason this request was made last year. Arrowcraft must meet the monthly bills and if all waited until May 31 to settle their accounts, this would be impossible. There are other ways in which clubs can help. Care should be taken not to over-order since this takes stock from other clubs when needed and leaves Arrowcraft in difficulty when re-turned after the holidays. Also, clubs should note there are some articles which cannot be returned. Neither can the club order be filled and mailed to various addresses. This demands too much time from the girls during the rush period and requires too much in the way of shipping sup-plies. Pi Phi owes a debt of gratitude to the clubs which had the courage to step forward and do their best. The following 22 clubs deserve special mention for these bought and paid for at least $1000 worth of Arrowcraft during the past fiscal year. Northern New Jersey.$2809.97 Kansas City, Mo $1287.58 Champaign-Urbana 2601.59 Dallas 1269.98 Houston 2400.09 Milwaukee 1167.44 Oklahoma City 2171.24 Arlington Heights 1156.00 Pasadena 2065.52 Cleveland East 1149.90 Denver 2014.10 Palo Alto 1105.52 Pittsburgh 1996.43 Fayetteville 1105.43 Tulsa 1909.34 Topeka 1079.73 Lincoln 1482.38 Portland, Ore 1066.23 Ames 1352.17 Madison 1055.39 South Bend 1351.63 Albuquerque 1015.68 The efforts of the other 212 clubs contributed to the success of Arrowcraft in securing a market for the mountain handcrafts. During the last 5 years, Pi Phi has paid THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 55 $276,556.24 to Craftsmen. One of life's greatest dividends is the feeling we have helped others in some way. When we sell Arrowcraft, we sell quality. Others may imitate but none duplicate! Facts and Figures All investments require money. It is gratifying to record that approximately 50 groups sizably increased their annual gifts to the Settlement School. This was a step towards overcoming inflation. Someone has said inflation is the art of cutting a dollar bill in half without touching the paper. Recent figures state that $1 out of 5 is eaten up by inflation. This means that what $4 bought 10 years ago, now costs $5. This also means that group gifts, which this year were the same as that given a decade ago, did not accomplish as much at Settlement School. The Committee gratefully received gifts for Settlement School from 102 chapters; this means there was only one which did not respond. Surely this year the chapters can be 100% which will be an achievement. The Clubs in the following Provinces were 100% in support of the national philanthropy: Beta Eta Mu Gamma Theta Xi Epsilon Lambda Pi The active chapters invested $2562.47 this year in Settlement School. This was an increase of $256.98 over the previous year. The alumnae clubs added $9359.45 which was a gain of $505.28. Texas Beta joined the ranks of chapters sending $100 or more; the other three have been regular members of the $100 club. Texas I' $150.00 Texas A $100.00 Texas B $100.00 Missouri B $100.00 The following 10 clubs invested $150 or more during 1957-58; those marked (*) made substantial increases over the previous year. St. Louis $800.00 *Pasadena $350.00 Cleveland East 510.00 Philadelphia 235.00 Kansas City, Mo 500.00 Milwaukee 225.00 *North Shore, Ill 500.00 Indianapolis 220.00 *Los Angeles 400.00 Denver, Sr 150.00 The above sums were increased by $9,048.18 from the Magazine Agency. This was $94.57 less. Elsewhere is printed the report which will give proper recognition to the faithful chairmen. Well executed plans could bring bigger returns next year. Many sent Christmas gifts to the School and Health Center. Boxes of good clothing were received and distributed as the need arose. At Convention $72.50 was collected for books in the Grace Coolidge Library at Settlement School, This gift was in memory of. Mrs. Coolidge who lived inMassachusetts and had served as a Province officer. Mrs. Mueller will supervise the selection of the needed books. More Pi Phis are realizing that it is appropriate to send gifts to the Settlement School treasurer in memory of friends who were members of the fraternity. Upon receipt of the contribution to the Memorial Fund, a suitable card is sent to the family. This fund was spent many times over, that is, in the minds of the Committee. A real attempt is made to choose very special purchases with this money and since there are so many places to use it, careful thought must be used. Another deep freeze would be a useful addition since the garden and chickens soon fill the one at Staff House. A station wagon could well replace the 1951 car; however there are some items high up on the Wishing List which require that the Fund should grow. Legacies have not been stressed too much in recent years; however to remember Settlement School in a will is one way to invest in the future. These gifts have been used for major improvements or building. This year the bequest from the Marian Stoner Huey estate was received and it is hoped that too much time will not elapse before the Joanna King Hempsted estate can be settled. A legal formwill appear in the ARROW as a reminder of this opportunity to invest in a living memorial. The above figures reveal vast investments of time, talents, and efforts on the part of many members in order to give substantial support to Settlement School. In spite of the generous gifts sent by a number of loyal groups, it should be called to attention that approXimately $30,000 in discounts went INTO the club treasuries from Arrowcraft sales and that little over $9,000 was sent FROM the clubs to support Settlement School. It would appear that instead of supporting Settlement School, some clubs were counting on the Settlement School products to support the local club and its projects. This is an arresting thought. As Lois Finger, the new chairman for Settlement School Publicity, stated so well in the fall letter to Pi Phi groups: "When you contribute to Settlement School, you do not contribute to Arrowcraft. Settlement School contributions go to maintain the buildings and grounds; to pay the salaries of our maintenance people, our teachers, and our staff; and to support the Health Center. You contribute to Arrowcraft, and so to the welfare of the mountain people, when you buy and sell Arrowcraft articles. When you hold Arrow-craft sales and contribute the net profits of that sale, you are contributing to ALL of the work at Gatlinburg." Unexpected demands were made on the Settlement School funds. This winter, Gatlinburg endured the longest and coldest period it has experienced in years. This required extra fuel and repair of pipes which burst after 30 years of service. At the end of the fiscal year, a water heater had to be replaced before Summer Workshop. Teachers' Cottage must be painted for the first time in six years. From now on, it would seem wise to paint one of the buildings each year. Fortunately paint holds up well in the Burg. Committee agreed some time ago it would never again tax the purse by painting everything at once. It is evident Committee must face surprises as well as inflation. Louise Dobler retired from the Committee after serving a term of 5 years as Publicity Chairman. She will be missed in many ways but one thing sure, she will be working for Settlement School and Arrowcraft in Everett, Washington. Smart program chairmen in that area should invite her to present their Settlement School program. Helen Russell joined the Committee to serve as Chairman of Slide Distribution. Helen brings a fine background of fraternity service as a former Province officer and member of the Committee on Chaperons. Future The true test of successful investing is achievement over a period long enough to include varied experiences and conditions. Settlement School has stood the test of time. New and intriguing opportunities constantly come to Pi Phi. The Chamber of Commerce in Gatlinburg, recognizing the ability of the Director of the Settlement School, elected her to be the president of that important civic organization. In addition to her strenuous schedule at Settlement School, Marion found time to participate in the Garden Club, PTA and various other groups. It is a challenge to realize that 5 girls, who wished to be in the dorm next year, must be refused. . . . The Arrow-craft "cottage industry" can demonstrate even more effectively to foreign visitors what can be done to help people help themselves. . . The same improved housing facilities for Workshop could afford greater use in the educational craft program. . . . Pi Phi must face the fact that its influence through this channel is making a significant contribution to American culture and that its influence is ever expanding. Future plans must be flexible and forward looking to make the best use of the Settlement School for education, health service and crafts. Your Settlement School Committee appreciates the trust you place in us. We assure you of our sincere belief in the soundness of your investment and foresee many opportunities for increased dividends.

The vast part of the Smokies lies within an easy day's drive of more than half of the nation's population. Actually, Gatlinburg is a two-mile long village of less than two thousand population at the junction of highways 73 and 441. These high-ways lead to: Loafing amid mountain splendor Fishing in crystal clear streams Hiking to skyline lookout points Trail riding to unopened valleys Gatlinburg And SETTLEMENT SCHOOL. Gatlinburg is a tourist town with 'approximately ninety motels and four hotels; a convention town with an auditorium with seating capacity of two thousand. The area has long been recognized for its many crafts. Settlement School is in the heart of Gatlinburg at the junction of the two highways. Even though we mingle with the towns-people, much of our activity is with the rural folks. This is also a land of superlatives with its lush vegetation and natural beauty. The place where we live is easy enough to find yes, easy to find, but difficult to forget! Here one finds the old, the new! Gatlinburg area is a combination of yesterday and today. We have neon signs, swimming pools, modern motels and hotels, many shops in the burg; and not too distant there are waterfalls, swimming holes, looms and log cabins. Pi Beta Phi memorial to our Founders is in the midst of such an area. It is a challenge to Pi Beta Phi to meet these changes as they arise. We trust that these changes from yesterday to to-morrow will be progressive. Due to all these attractions, there are many visitors, many of whom are Pi Phis. If you ever come this way, the Settlement School WELCOME MAT is out to each of you. Arrowcraft Coming in on either highway one soon sees the Arrow-craft Shop. Undoubtedly this is our largest contact with Pi Beta Phis everywhere. Manager Elizabeth Rue greets folks whenever possible. Pi Phis can be proud of the splendid record of their Alumni Clubs the nucleus of Arrowcraft business. With the many successful sales con-ducted by our Settlement School chairmen and helpers their slogan could be "the reward of a thing well done is to have done it !" North, South, East, and West you have done it! Many thanks to each of you. The new price lists will picture many of the new articles. Chairmen will doubtless have trouble choosing there is such a large variety. The Cookbooks have sold well, being in the second printing (10,000 each printing) in less than a year. Several changes in personnel were made at Arrowcraft Gene Redding returned as designer, having been away since 1945. As a consequence there are many new designs. Gene succeeded Tina McMorran who is now retired and free-lancing in her home with weaving specialties. Edna Cook, who served as salesgirl or assistant to the weaving designer for ten years, was married and lives in Detroit. Faye Cook succeeds her sister. Emily Cantwell is now bookkeeper, succeeding Eunice Cole. Nella Cook Hill, Nadine Grooms, Charlotte Moyer, and Susie Maples complete the staff. Mrs. McCutchan continues to sell Arrowcraft in the Mountain View lobby. Health Center Perhaps the biggest event at Health Center was the initiation of our nurse Marjorie Chalmers at Convention. We are happy to have Marjorie wearing the Arrow. To summarize her work one might say it is preventive a gradual change from years past. This includes the maternaland infant clinics, preschool clinic, T.B. x-ray clinic, physical examinations and inspections in all the rooms, follow-ups when necessary, and inoculations. Community Projects We believe that good public relations make for better community service and community service is one of our missions in life. Several staff members participate in one or more projects, among them Community Chest, Civil Defense, Committees of the churches, Scout counciling, Chamber of Commerce president, P.T.A., and Garden Club vice-president. Dormitories The dormitory part of our program is perhaps the most challenging activity at Settlement School because of its far-reaching scope. Many of the results are immeasurable. Fifteen children (eight boys, seven girls) completed the school year in our dormitory. Several were good students, several very poor. Naturally, I am concerned about the latter. A trade school might be the answer. Not having that, it is difficult to convince them that an education is important. Three dormitory girls made Beta Club, one boy and one girl were on Student Council, and three were on the football squad. One girl paid for music lessons by doing extra chores. A dormitory Halloween party with guests, a Christmas party with gift exchange, Valentine party, Class party, and picnic were the larger events during the year. There was evidence of dormitory "spirit." Two girls came back during the summer to chat. Linda said "'Gee, I sure do miss this place !" The other replied "Me, too." Dwight has lived in our dormitory three years, going to Pi Beta Phi high school. His home is twelve miles out in Wear's Valley. Dwight loves the outdoors, and is a dreamer, a young poet. When asked what he was doing on his vacation, he replied, "just settin'." I know he would "just set" as much as possible. The following is an ex-ample of his dreaming (he says he wrote this in algebra class) : THE WANDERER I walk this winding, upward path That few human feet have trod, Wonderous beauty all around, Created by the hand of God. And as, alone, I walk along I think of things I've left behind And how the Lord looks down on me By giving me this peace of mind. Across the way the sun now shines, Across the glen a bird now sings ; Through the tall green hickory trees A frisky little squirrel swings. The day grows older with each passing hour, The sun climbs higher, so do I ; To the top of the towering peak I climb, To the top of the tower, into the sky. From this point I look about And wonder more upon the sight; Far out across the tree-clad hills A great bald eagle makes his flight ; To the west and north is a man-scarred land With cities, factories, smoke, and noise; To the south and east lies God's great land, Wild with freedom, love, and joys. I may wander far and near But when my heart beat cloth cease, 'Tis here I want my body laid To rest in quiet, solemn peace. -DWIGHT DAVENPORT One day each week two music teachers give private piano lessons in Teachers and Stuart dormitories thus adding a bit of culture to our program. School Again Pi Beta Phi school was rated grade "A" for the THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 61 year. There are approximately one hundred seventy-five high school students with a graduating class of forty. Pi Beta Phi provided the Arts and Crafts, Woodcraft (two classes), Music, Physical Education, and Health Center with a full-time nurse. Hiring the Physical Education instructor is to be discontinued this year '58-'59. Tennessee schools rate very low in the nation, and our Sevier County very low in the state. So, there is still much room for improvement. The much-needed new lunch room has been added to the County gymnasium and is to be ready for school in September. Anna Belle Lee, who graduated from the University of Tennessee in June, is to teach Arts and Crafts for '58-'59. Mrs. Walter Enlow is to teach Music, and Carl Huskey teaches Woodcraft. One rural school, The Glades, is the only one-room school in our twelve mile area. Gradually they are disappearing; however, there are still eleven in the county. Farm To call our gardening and chicken-raising a farm is a misnomer. Actually much of our acreage is not tillable. There is considerable wooded land. Most of the garden produce finds its way to our table, directly or via the freezer. Richard Watson has been with us about eight years ,as farmer. His avocation is the ministry. Baptist, of course! Maintenance This could well be termed the most important department of all. There is much to maintain 78 acres, 12 buildings. Honestly, there is hardly a day that there is not some repair, somewhere. Having the second highest rainfall in the United States, there is much water damage. Much of the repair is negative. If it were not done, the result would be "sorry." Orlie Watson takes pride in the various lines of duty through his thirty years at Settlement School. He is carpenter, plumber, janitor, painter all in one day. Neal works with Orlie wherever duty calls. He, too, could be called "handyman." Orlie and Neal ship the many cartons of express from Arrowcraft to our Clubs. Weather never interferes. Pi Beta Phi University of Tennessee Workshop Marian Heard served in setting up Workshop, then pre-pared for leading the Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennessee Craft Tour to Europe for six weeks. Jane Glass continued to guide Workshop through its fourteenth season. Each year I am amazed at the individuals coming from all walks of life and various ages for a common purpose to study crafts. Each year the results seem to exceed the previous year in workmanship. Beginners surprise themselves and usually are quite proud of their work. There are several reasons why it is desirable to replace the temporary, make-shift dormitory in the old white school building. Our sturdy red barn could be converted to fill this need. This improvement for Settlement School would have untold possibilities with other projects, both in housing and workshops with multiple-purpose rooms. This could be kept on an educational level thus maintaining the goal of our Founders. Pi Beta Phis everywhere should be proud of this evidence here at Settlement School evidence of many hours and years of tireless and devoted effort of many of their members. Staff Starting my fifth year as Settlement School director I actually have a "queer" feeling. Why? Because for thefirst time I have a complete staff at the beginning of school. Even though several have years of service to their credit, usually someone is making or about to make a change. Sharon Dexter, Illinois Zeta, has recently come to serve as assistant to the director. I am sure Sharon will become very valuable to Settlement School. Ruth Shantz Spelman, Illinois Epsilon, has been with us a year as housemother, literally filling a need with the dormitory children. Gene Redding's return as designer at Arrowcraft is a homecoming because she was here sixteen out of twenty years-1925-1945. Susie Maples assists Gene Redding in the weaving department in addition to part-time selling at Arrowcraft. Mrs. Lela Adams is beginning her sixth year as cook for staff. She not only cooks, but supervises the deep freeze, canning and jelly making. Something New In June the Southern Highland Guild sponsored a three-day weaving workshop at our school. We were happy to serve as hosts for this educational project of the Guild. Approximately sixty attended. The Guild is planning future workshops in other crafts. For the first time in eight years the Southern Highland Guild Fair is to be in Gatlinburg in 1959. This is an event that many follow. If you have never been to the Craftsman's Fair, that would be a wonderful opportunity to see craftsmen at work, and to buy choice pieces. Experts in over forty crafts bring their displays and sales during the five-day period in late July. Of course, our, Arrowcraft shop sells and exhibits. Theatres Good entertainment for the tourists was available during the summer. Mr. John Richards brought his company from the New York American Academy of Dramatic Art for the twelfth season. The high school auditorium has been the location of this so-called Gateway Theatre. As usual a repertory of five plays was offered "Bus Stop," "Street Car Named Desire," "Come Back Little Sheba," "Out-ward Bound," "Mouse Trap." The Old Timers met again for their annual Harp Singing and celebration the last Saturday in June. "Chucky Jack" depicting the early history of Tennessee completed its third season as an outdoor pageant in a natural setting four miles east of Gatlinburg. Gifts Words are inadequate to express our appreciation of the many gifts to Settlement School gifts for the dormitories, Health Center, Christmas, clothing and books. All these gifts have been listed elsewhere. Again, I wish to extend our appreciation to each donor. It is heartening to receive them. When these gifts from everywhere arrive one realizes the magnitude of this project of Pi Beta Phi. Thank you To Grand Council, to Settlement School Committee, to Province Officers, to the many Pi Phis everywhere I extend a great big THANK YOU for your cooperation in helping to make this project something of which our Founders would be proud. Our slogan might be: "There is hope for the future And help in the past But for WORK There is only TODAY" Respectfully submitted, MARION W. MUELLER, Director Pi Beta Phi Settlement School

The vast part of the Smokies lies within an easy day's drive of more than half of the nation's population. Actually, Gatlinburg is a two-mile long village of less than two thousand population at the junction of highways 73 and 441. These high-ways lead to: Loafing amid mountain splendor Fishing in crystal clear streams Hiking to skyline lookout points Trail riding to unopened valleys Gatlinburg And SETTLEMENT SCHOOL. Gatlinburg is a tourist town with 'approximately ninety motels and four hotels; a convention town with an auditorium with seating capacity of two thousand. The area has long been recognized for its many crafts. Settlement School is in the heart of Gatlinburg at the junction of the two highways. Even though we mingle with the towns-people, much of our activity is with the rural folks. This is also a land of superlatives with its lush vegetation and natural beauty. The place where we live is easy enough to find yes, easy to find, but difficult to forget! Here one finds the old, the new! Gatlinburg area is a combination of yesterday and today. We have neon signs, swimming pools, modern motels and hotels, many shops in the burg; and not too distant there are waterfalls, swimming holes, looms and log cabins. Pi Beta Phi memorial to our Founders is in the midst of such an area. It is a challenge to Pi Beta Phi to meet these changes as they arise. We trust that these changes from yesterday to to-morrow will be progressive. Due to all these attractions, there are many visitors, many of whom are Pi Phis. If you ever come this way, the Settlement School WELCOME MAT is out to each of you. Arrowcraft Coming in on either highway one soon sees the Arrow-craft Shop. Undoubtedly this is our largest contact with Pi Beta Phis everywhere. Manager Elizabeth Rue greets folks whenever possible. Pi Phis can be proud of the splendid record of their Alumni Clubs the nucleus of Arrowcraft business. With the many successful sales con-ducted by our Settlement School chairmen and helpers their slogan could be "the reward of a thing well done is to have done it !" North, South, East, and West you have done it! Many thanks to each of you. The new price lists will picture many of the new articles. Chairmen will doubtless have trouble choosing there is such a large variety. The Cookbooks have sold well, being in the second printing (10,000 each printing) in less than a year. Several changes in personnel were made at Arrowcraft Gene Redding returned as designer, having been away since 1945. As a consequence there are many new designs. Gene succeeded Tina McMorran who is now retired and free-lancing in her home with weaving specialties. Edna Cook, who served as salesgirl or assistant to the weaving designer for ten years, was married and lives in Detroit. Faye Cook succeeds her sister. Emily Cantwell is now bookkeeper, succeeding Eunice Cole. Nella Cook Hill, Nadine Grooms, Charlotte Moyer, and Susie Maples complete the staff. Mrs. McCutchan continues to sell Arrowcraft in the Mountain View lobby. Health Center Perhaps the biggest event at Health Center was the initiation of our nurse Marjorie Chalmers at Convention. We are happy to have Marjorie wearing the Arrow. To summarize her work one might say it is preventive a gradual change from years past. This includes the maternaland infant clinics, preschool clinic, T.B. x-ray clinic, physical examinations and inspections in all the rooms, follow-ups when necessary, and inoculations. Community Projects We believe that good public relations make for better community service and community service is one of our missions in life. Several staff members participate in one or more projects, among them Community Chest, Civil Defense, Committees of the churches, Scout counciling, Chamber of Commerce president, P.T.A., and Garden Club vice-president. Dormitories The dormitory part of our program is perhaps the most challenging activity at Settlement School because of its far-reaching scope. Many of the results are immeasurable. Fifteen children (eight boys, seven girls) completed the school year in our dormitory. Several were good students, several very poor. Naturally, I am concerned about the latter. A trade school might be the answer. Not having that, it is difficult to convince them that an education is important. Three dormitory girls made Beta Club, one boy and one girl were on Student Council, and three were on the football squad. One girl paid for music lessons by doing extra chores. A dormitory Halloween party with guests, a Christmas party with gift exchange, Valentine party, Class party, and picnic were the larger events during the year. There was evidence of dormitory "spirit." Two girls came back during the summer to chat. Linda said "'Gee, I sure do miss this place !" The other replied "Me, too." Dwight has lived in our dormitory three years, going to Pi Beta Phi high school. His home is twelve miles out in Wear's Valley. Dwight loves the outdoors, and is a dreamer, a young poet. When asked what he was doing on his vacation, he replied, "just settin'." I know he would "just set" as much as possible. The following is an ex-ample of his dreaming (he says he wrote this in algebra class) : THE WANDERER I walk this winding, upward path That few human feet have trod, Wonderous beauty all around, Created by the hand of God. And as, alone, I walk along I think of things I've left behind And how the Lord looks down on me By giving me this peace of mind. Across the way the sun now shines, Across the glen a bird now sings ; Through the tall green hickory trees A frisky little squirrel swings. The day grows older with each passing hour, The sun climbs higher, so do I ; To the top of the towering peak I climb, To the top of the tower, into the sky. From this point I look about And wonder more upon the sight; Far out across the tree-clad hills A great bald eagle makes his flight ; To the west and north is a man-scarred land With cities, factories, smoke, and noise; To the south and east lies God's great land, Wild with freedom, love, and joys. I may wander far and near But when my heart beat cloth cease, 'Tis here I want my body laid To rest in quiet, solemn peace. -DWIGHT DAVENPORT One day each week two music teachers give private piano lessons in Teachers and Stuart dormitories thus adding a bit of culture to our program. School Again Pi Beta Phi school was rated grade "A" for the THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 61 year. There are approximately one hundred seventy-five high school students with a graduating class of forty. Pi Beta Phi provided the Arts and Crafts, Woodcraft (two classes), Music, Physical Education, and Health Center with a full-time nurse. Hiring the Physical Education instructor is to be discontinued this year '58-'59. Tennessee schools rate very low in the nation, and our Sevier County very low in the state. So, there is still much room for improvement. The much-needed new lunch room has been added to the County gymnasium and is to be ready for school in September. Anna Belle Lee, who graduated from the University of Tennessee in June, is to teach Arts and Crafts for '58-'59. Mrs. Walter Enlow is to teach Music, and Carl Huskey teaches Woodcraft. One rural school, The Glades, is the only one-room school in our twelve mile area. Gradually they are disappearing; however, there are still eleven in the county. Farm To call our gardening and chicken-raising a farm is a misnomer. Actually much of our acreage is not tillable. There is considerable wooded land. Most of the garden produce finds its way to our table, directly or via the freezer. Richard Watson has been with us about eight years ,as farmer. His avocation is the ministry. Baptist, of course! Maintenance This could well be termed the most important department of all. There is much to maintain 78 acres, 12 buildings. Honestly, there is hardly a day that there is not some repair, somewhere. Having the second highest rainfall in the United States, there is much water damage. Much of the repair is negative. If it were not done, the result would be "sorry." Orlie Watson takes pride in the various lines of duty through his thirty years at Settlement School. He is carpenter, plumber, janitor, painter all in one day. Neal works with Orlie wherever duty calls. He, too, could be called "handyman." Orlie and Neal ship the many cartons of express from Arrowcraft to our Clubs. Weather never interferes. Pi Beta Phi University of Tennessee Workshop Marian Heard served in setting up Workshop, then pre-pared for leading the Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennessee Craft Tour to Europe for six weeks. Jane Glass continued to guide Workshop through its fourteenth season. Each year I am amazed at the individuals coming from all walks of life and various ages for a common purpose to study crafts. Each year the results seem to exceed the previous year in workmanship. Beginners surprise themselves and usually are quite proud of their work. There are several reasons why it is desirable to replace the temporary, make-shift dormitory in the old white school building. Our sturdy red barn could be converted to fill this need. This improvement for Settlement School would have untold possibilities with other projects, both in housing and workshops with multiple-purpose rooms. This could be kept on an educational level thus maintaining the goal of our Founders. Pi Beta Phis everywhere should be proud of this evidence here at Settlement School evidence of many hours and years of tireless and devoted effort of many of their members. Staff Starting my fifth year as Settlement School director I actually have a "queer" feeling. Why? Because for thefirst time I have a complete staff at the beginning of school. Even though several have years of service to their credit, usually someone is making or about to make a change. Sharon Dexter, Illinois Zeta, has recently come to serve as assistant to the director. I am sure Sharon will become very valuable to Settlement School. Ruth Shantz Spelman, Illinois Epsilon, has been with us a year as housemother, literally filling a need with the dormitory children. Gene Redding's return as designer at Arrowcraft is a homecoming because she was here sixteen out of twenty years-1925-1945. Susie Maples assists Gene Redding in the weaving department in addition to part-time selling at Arrowcraft. Mrs. Lela Adams is beginning her sixth year as cook for staff. She not only cooks, but supervises the deep freeze, canning and jelly making. Something New In June the Southern Highland Guild sponsored a three-day weaving workshop at our school. We were happy to serve as hosts for this educational project of the Guild. Approximately sixty attended. The Guild is planning future workshops in other crafts. For the first time in eight years the Southern Highland Guild Fair is to be in Gatlinburg in 1959. This is an event that many follow. If you have never been to the Craftsman's Fair, that would be a wonderful opportunity to see craftsmen at work, and to buy choice pieces. Experts in over forty crafts bring their displays and sales during the five-day period in late July. Of course, our, Arrowcraft shop sells and exhibits. Theatres Good entertainment for the tourists was available during the summer. Mr. John Richards brought his company from the New York American Academy of Dramatic Art for the twelfth season. The high school auditorium has been the location of this so-called Gateway Theatre. As usual a repertory of five plays was offered "Bus Stop," "Street Car Named Desire," "Come Back Little Sheba," "Out-ward Bound," "Mouse Trap." The Old Timers met again for their annual Harp Singing and celebration the last Saturday in June. "Chucky Jack" depicting the early history of Tennessee completed its third season as an outdoor pageant in a natural setting four miles east of Gatlinburg. Gifts Words are inadequate to express our appreciation of the many gifts to Settlement School gifts for the dormitories, Health Center, Christmas, clothing and books. All these gifts have been listed elsewhere. Again, I wish to extend our appreciation to each donor. It is heartening to receive them. When these gifts from everywhere arrive one realizes the magnitude of this project of Pi Beta Phi. Thank you To Grand Council, to Settlement School Committee, to Province Officers, to the many Pi Phis everywhere I extend a great big THANK YOU for your cooperation in helping to make this project something of which our Founders would be proud. Our slogan might be: "There is hope for the future And help in the past But for WORK There is only TODAY" Respectfully submitted, MARION W. MUELLER, Director Pi Beta Phi Settlement School

The vast part of the Smokies lies within an easy day's drive of more than half of the nation's population. Actually, Gatlinburg is a two-mile long village of less than two thousand population at the junction of highways 73 and 441. These high-ways lead to: Loafing amid mountain splendor Fishing in crystal clear streams Hiking to skyline lookout points Trail riding to unopened valleys Gatlinburg And SETTLEMENT SCHOOL. Gatlinburg is a tourist town with 'approximately ninety motels and four hotels; a convention town with an auditorium with seating capacity of two thousand. The area has long been recognized for its many crafts. Settlement School is in the heart of Gatlinburg at the junction of the two highways. Even though we mingle with the towns-people, much of our activity is with the rural folks. This is also a land of superlatives with its lush vegetation and natural beauty. The place where we live is easy enough to find yes, easy to find, but difficult to forget! Here one finds the old, the new! Gatlinburg area is a combination of yesterday and today. We have neon signs, swimming pools, modern motels and hotels, many shops in the burg; and not too distant there are waterfalls, swimming holes, looms and log cabins. Pi Beta Phi memorial to our Founders is in the midst of such an area. It is a challenge to Pi Beta Phi to meet these changes as they arise. We trust that these changes from yesterday to to-morrow will be progressive. Due to all these attractions, there are many visitors, many of whom are Pi Phis. If you ever come this way, the Settlement School WELCOME MAT is out to each of you. Arrowcraft Coming in on either highway one soon sees the Arrow-craft Shop. Undoubtedly this is our largest contact with Pi Beta Phis everywhere. Manager Elizabeth Rue greets folks whenever possible. Pi Phis can be proud of the splendid record of their Alumni Clubs the nucleus of Arrowcraft business. With the many successful sales con-ducted by our Settlement School chairmen and helpers their slogan could be "the reward of a thing well done is to have done it !" North, South, East, and West you have done it! Many thanks to each of you. The new price lists will picture many of the new articles. Chairmen will doubtless have trouble choosing there is such a large variety. The Cookbooks have sold well, being in the second printing (10,000 each printing) in less than a year. Several changes in personnel were made at Arrowcraft Gene Redding returned as designer, having been away since 1945. As a consequence there are many new designs. Gene succeeded Tina McMorran who is now retired and free-lancing in her home with weaving specialties. Edna Cook, who served as salesgirl or assistant to the weaving designer for ten years, was married and lives in Detroit. Faye Cook succeeds her sister. Emily Cantwell is now bookkeeper, succeeding Eunice Cole. Nella Cook Hill, Nadine Grooms, Charlotte Moyer, and Susie Maples complete the staff. Mrs. McCutchan continues to sell Arrowcraft in the Mountain View lobby. Health Center Perhaps the biggest event at Health Center was the initiation of our nurse Marjorie Chalmers at Convention. We are happy to have Marjorie wearing the Arrow. To summarize her work one might say it is preventive a gradual change from years past. This includes the maternaland infant clinics, preschool clinic, T.B. x-ray clinic, physical examinations and inspections in all the rooms, follow-ups when necessary, and inoculations. Community Projects We believe that good public relations make for better community service and community service is one of our missions in life. Several staff members participate in one or more projects, among them Community Chest, Civil Defense, Committees of the churches, Scout counciling, Chamber of Commerce president, P.T.A., and Garden Club vice-president. Dormitories The dormitory part of our program is perhaps the most challenging activity at Settlement School because of its far-reaching scope. Many of the results are immeasurable. Fifteen children (eight boys, seven girls) completed the school year in our dormitory. Several were good students, several very poor. Naturally, I am concerned about the latter. A trade school might be the answer. Not having that, it is difficult to convince them that an education is important. Three dormitory girls made Beta Club, one boy and one girl were on Student Council, and three were on the football squad. One girl paid for music lessons by doing extra chores. A dormitory Halloween party with guests, a Christmas party with gift exchange, Valentine party, Class party, and picnic were the larger events during the year. There was evidence of dormitory "spirit." Two girls came back during the summer to chat. Linda said "'Gee, I sure do miss this place !" The other replied "Me, too." Dwight has lived in our dormitory three years, going to Pi Beta Phi high school. His home is twelve miles out in Wear's Valley. Dwight loves the outdoors, and is a dreamer, a young poet. When asked what he was doing on his vacation, he replied, "just settin'." I know he would "just set" as much as possible. The following is an ex-ample of his dreaming (he says he wrote this in algebra class) : THE WANDERER I walk this winding, upward path That few human feet have trod, Wonderous beauty all around, Created by the hand of God. And as, alone, I walk along I think of things I've left behind And how the Lord looks down on me By giving me this peace of mind. Across the way the sun now shines, Across the glen a bird now sings ; Through the tall green hickory trees A frisky little squirrel swings. The day grows older with each passing hour, The sun climbs higher, so do I ; To the top of the towering peak I climb, To the top of the tower, into the sky. From this point I look about And wonder more upon the sight; Far out across the tree-clad hills A great bald eagle makes his flight ; To the west and north is a man-scarred land With cities, factories, smoke, and noise; To the south and east lies God's great land, Wild with freedom, love, and joys. I may wander far and near But when my heart beat cloth cease, 'Tis here I want my body laid To rest in quiet, solemn peace. -DWIGHT DAVENPORT One day each week two music teachers give private piano lessons in Teachers and Stuart dormitories thus adding a bit of culture to our program. School Again Pi Beta Phi school was rated grade "A" for the THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 61 year. There are approximately one hundred seventy-five high school students with a graduating class of forty. Pi Beta Phi provided the Arts and Crafts, Woodcraft (two classes), Music, Physical Education, and Health Center with a full-time nurse. Hiring the Physical Education instructor is to be discontinued this year '58-'59. Tennessee schools rate very low in the nation, and our Sevier County very low in the state. So, there is still much room for improvement. The much-needed new lunch room has been added to the County gymnasium and is to be ready for school in September. Anna Belle Lee, who graduated from the University of Tennessee in June, is to teach Arts and Crafts for '58-'59. Mrs. Walter Enlow is to teach Music, and Carl Huskey teaches Woodcraft. One rural school, The Glades, is the only one-room school in our twelve mile area. Gradually they are disappearing; however, there are still eleven in the county. Farm To call our gardening and chicken-raising a farm is a misnomer. Actually much of our acreage is not tillable. There is considerable wooded land. Most of the garden produce finds its way to our table, directly or via the freezer. Richard Watson has been with us about eight years ,as farmer. His avocation is the ministry. Baptist, of course! Maintenance This could well be termed the most important department of all. There is much to maintain 78 acres, 12 buildings. Honestly, there is hardly a day that there is not some repair, somewhere. Having the second highest rainfall in the United States, there is much water damage. Much of the repair is negative. If it were not done, the result would be "sorry." Orlie Watson takes pride in the various lines of duty through his thirty years at Settlement School. He is carpenter, plumber, janitor, painter all in one day. Neal works with Orlie wherever duty calls. He, too, could be called "handyman." Orlie and Neal ship the many cartons of express from Arrowcraft to our Clubs. Weather never interferes. Pi Beta Phi University of Tennessee Workshop Marian Heard served in setting up Workshop, then pre-pared for leading the Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennessee Craft Tour to Europe for six weeks. Jane Glass continued to guide Workshop through its fourteenth season. Each year I am amazed at the individuals coming from all walks of life and various ages for a common purpose to study crafts. Each year the results seem to exceed the previous year in workmanship. Beginners surprise themselves and usually are quite proud of their work. There are several reasons why it is desirable to replace the temporary, make-shift dormitory in the old white school building. Our sturdy red barn could be converted to fill this need. This improvement for Settlement School would have untold possibilities with other projects, both in housing and workshops with multiple-purpose rooms. This could be kept on an educational level thus maintaining the goal of our Founders. Pi Beta Phis everywhere should be proud of this evidence here at Settlement School evidence of many hours and years of tireless and devoted effort of many of their members. Staff Starting my fifth year as Settlement School director I actually have a "queer" feeling. Why? Because for thefirst time I have a complete staff at the beginning of school. Even though several have years of service to their credit, usually someone is making or about to make a change. Sharon Dexter, Illinois Zeta, has recently come to serve as assistant to the director. I am sure Sharon will become very valuable to Settlement School. Ruth Shantz Spelman, Illinois Epsilon, has been with us a year as housemother, literally filling a need with the dormitory children. Gene Redding's return as designer at Arrowcraft is a homecoming because she was here sixteen out of twenty years-1925-1945. Susie Maples assists Gene Redding in the weaving department in addition to part-time selling at Arrowcraft. Mrs. Lela Adams is beginning her sixth year as cook for staff. She not only cooks, but supervises the deep freeze, canning and jelly making. Something New In June the Southern Highland Guild sponsored a three-day weaving workshop at our school. We were happy to serve as hosts for this educational project of the Guild. Approximately sixty attended. The Guild is planning future workshops in other crafts. For the first time in eight years the Southern Highland Guild Fair is to be in Gatlinburg in 1959. This is an event that many follow. If you have never been to the Craftsman's Fair, that would be a wonderful opportunity to see craftsmen at work, and to buy choice pieces. Experts in over forty crafts bring their displays and sales during the five-day period in late July. Of course, our, Arrowcraft shop sells and exhibits. Theatres Good entertainment for the tourists was available during the summer. Mr. John Richards brought his company from the New York American Academy of Dramatic Art for the twelfth season. The high school auditorium has been the location of this so-called Gateway Theatre. As usual a repertory of five plays was offered "Bus Stop," "Street Car Named Desire," "Come Back Little Sheba," "Out-ward Bound," "Mouse Trap." The Old Timers met again for their annual Harp Singing and celebration the last Saturday in June. "Chucky Jack" depicting the early history of Tennessee completed its third season as an outdoor pageant in a natural setting four miles east of Gatlinburg. Gifts Words are inadequate to express our appreciation of the many gifts to Settlement School gifts for the dormitories, Health Center, Christmas, clothing and books. All these gifts have been listed elsewhere. Again, I wish to extend our appreciation to each donor. It is heartening to receive them. When these gifts from everywhere arrive one realizes the magnitude of this project of Pi Beta Phi. Thank you To Grand Council, to Settlement School Committee, to Province Officers, to the many Pi Phis everywhere I extend a great big THANK YOU for your cooperation in helping to make this project something of which our Founders would be proud. Our slogan might be: "There is hope for the future And help in the past But for WORK There is only TODAY" Respectfully submitted, MARION W. MUELLER, Director Pi Beta Phi Settlement School

Such a statement should reveal the re-turns on the long-term investment and also analyse the prospects for the future. This must include more than statistics for there are human values that lie behind the facts. It is impossible to estimate the influence of the Settlement School on the lives of thousands. This diversified pro-gram has placed emphasis on education, health, and the preservation and promotion of crafts. The wisdom of this practice, during the 46 years, has been borne out in the passing of time. This report will show the progress made in the various fields during the 1957-58 year. Education Rewarding dividends have come from Pi Beta Phi's original investment in education, at the time when a narrow wagon trail was the only entrance to Gatlinburg and the hamlet numbered 6 houses, a blacksmith shop, and the Baptist Church. People settled near the school so that their children could profit by education, and because of Pi Phi, a town grew. The school still bears the name of Pi Beta Phi although the County maintains it. At no time has Sevier County been able to carry on an adequate school program without state aid; so again this year Pi Phi augmented the basic minimum curriculum with teachers for Physical Education and Health, Arts and Crafts, Wood-working and Music. Exceptionally fine instructors were secured and Mrs. Mueller, Director of Settlement School, continued to serve in an advisory capacity with the school principal and the County Board of Education. Due to the high standards and persistent efforts of Mr. Carl Lewelling, the principal, the school once again received an "A" rating. There is more than one way in which to invest in education at Settlement School. The most gratifying returns have come from the dormitory program for mountain young people who live too far from a high school to travel daily by school bus. The fall of 1957 found 17 boys and girls registered for a place in the dormitories. Supervised by Mrs. Mueller and Mrs. Ruth Spelman the House Mother, the children worked for a certain number of hours, in addition to the monthly $5.00 payment, for the privilege of living in the dorm. The training received from work experience offered an extra dividend in addition to the class-room instruction. Study tables were established for those coming from rural schools. The Brendel scholarship legacy made it possible to secure remedial reading for a freshman and also to award a scholarship to an outstanding dorm girl whose family, because of illness, found it difficult to keep two children in school. The Director always found time to advise when asked and attempted to help the individuals to find work or to solve a personal problem. She drove the children to some of the high school football and basketball games and planned seasonal parties with the assistance of committees from the young people. This coming year, the Director will have the co-operation of her new Assistant, Sharon Dexter, Illinois Zeta, and so the dorm program will continue to make an impression on the lives of the mountain young people. It is wonderful to have a young Pi Phi on the staff. Besides, character-building is done by piecework and that requires a full staff. It was possible to give one of the dorm girls, who graduated this May, a scholarship for advanced study from the Alspaugh Scholarship. Were it possible to tell of the various children, Pi Phi would be proud of her foresight in investing in these young people. Each member should realize and beglad that every Settlement School gift not only contributes to the maintenance of staff and buildings, but also under-writes the opportunity for a high school education for those who otherwise might not have the chance. The staff house lodged the resident staff and furnished reasonable, pleasant living for out-of-town teachers. This was another way Pi Phi furthered education for, with the low salary scale for Tennessee teachers, there is difficulty in attracting and holding qualified teachers. In the summer, the staff of the Summer Craft Workshop was housed in this building while the entire student body ate in the large dining-room. The fourth type of investment in the educational field, the Summer Craft Workshop, is one that made use of the plant in the summer. The dormitories, which housed the mountain young people in winter, and the classrooms were taken over by adults from all over the U.S.A. and abroad. The Workshop, jointly sponsored by Pi Beta Phi and the University of Tennessee, long ago passed the experimental stage. The 14th annual Workshop was noteworthy for enthusiasm and exceptionally fine work. After setting up and getting the Workshop off to a good start, Marion Heard turned it over to her co-director, Jane Glass. Marion left to be the instructor for the second Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennessee Foreign Study Craft Tour. The Staff of the College of Home Economics at UT, as usual, gave excellent co-operation. Dean Jessie Harris, whose valuable counsel is responsible for much of the success of the project, retires this fall. Words are inadequate to express the fraternity's appreciation for the assistance of this capable Pi Phi. It is a comfort to know that the Settlement School Committee will work with Acting Dean Ida Anders who is a loyal Pi Phi, well-informed concerning the Workshop. Already there are significant reasons indicating the 1959 Workshop should be much larger. First, the Workshop session will start a week later; those who found this year's early beginning date inconvenient, will be pleased. There will be neither a Pi Phi Convention nor Foreign Study Craft Tour to offer a counter-attraction. The deciding factor for many will be the need tax ruling which allows deduction for expenditures made for education undertaken primarily for the maintaining or improving of skills required in the individual's employment, trade or business. While this will not apply to those in pursuit of a hobby or the community volunteer, it will encourage producing artists, teachers, physiotherapists, and welfare workers to seek additional skills, provided that living expenses and tuition are in line. One hurdle to overcome is the inadequate housing plan. The temporary plan of 14 years' standing, which requires the conversion of the 42 year old grade school building into a dormitory, presents almost insurmountable difficulties. In spite of herculean efforts on the part of the staff, the results are not up to Pi Phi standards. The Southern Highland Guild held a short Weaving Workshop at Settlement School just before the opening of the Summer Craft Workshop. The resident staff proved most efficient in serving the meals with the help of several dorm girls. This challenges the Committee to make even greater use of the facilities at Settlement School and to meet important, present day opportunities for service. Pi Phi came to Gatlinburg to bring educational opportunities but found the native crafts which it could help the mountain people share with the rest of the world. It is thrilling to dream of short Workshops, national in scope, for occupational therapists, craft instructors for crippled children and many others who would find it pleasant in the Smokies in the spring, late summer and early fall. Recently an edu 53 54 THE ARROW OF P1 BETA PHI cator confronted us with a new trend. Just as the seniors of Pi Beta Phi school take a trip to Washington each spring, students and teachers in large cities need to come to such a place as the Smokies. They could be brought into the area for several days in workshops to study early American life, Indian life and lore, and wild life and nature study. What a chance to pioneer again in Gatlinburg! There is no use to go back to seek a lost opportunity; someone else has found it. As mentioned in the 1956 report, the red barn strategically located near the staff house dining-room, could have a future. This could be the answer to the housing problem and greater use of the Settlement. Well, one, can dream! Here is a prospect for the future advancement of education, health and crafts to which we, are committed at Settlement School. Health Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers is now the Pi Phi nurse in more than one way. For over 22 years she has been in charge of the Jennie Nicol Memorial Health Center, and at the Swampscott 'Convention, she was initiated into Pi Beta Phi. In the 38 years since the fraternity established the health service, Gatlinburg has changed from a sleepy little village. The health service has changed, too, for the policy has always been to meet the needs of the community and area whenever possible. Early in the history of the Health Center, the diseases which were then prevalent, were attacked and soon the community was almost 'free of hookworm, typhoid and diphtheria. Now 93% of the Pi Beta Phi school children have had all 3 Salk inoculations; Health Center has given nearly 3000 doses. Classes in bed-side care and health education steadily reduce the demands on the community nursing service; however there is in-creased pressure for better instruction, for more protection from accident and disease, and early recognition of correctable defects. Marjorie visited the one remaining rural school in the Gatlinburg area and gave the usual examinations and inoculations. Her article in the Summer ARROW gave a glimpse of that part of her work. Maternal and infant welfare continued to be an important phase of the health service. Every Friday was set aside 'for the well baby clinic. Other clinics were carefully planned from time to time. Detailed records were filed for future reference. Nurse Marjorie continued to be as active as time permitted in various community activities such as Community Chest, Civil Defense, Social Service, Committees of the Church, and Scout Counciling. The nurse believes community service is her mission in life.

Better a fence at the edge of the precipice than a hospital at the foot. Crafts One of the important "securities" in the Settlement School investment portfolio is the Arrowcraft project development. Native crafts were fast dying out when Pi Phi introduced the cottage crafts to the mountain folks who needed this economic security. In elevating the traditional crafts to an art, Pi Phi has developed an increased self-respect among the mountain craftsmen and a deeper appreciation of their heritage from the past. The Settlement School has been instrumental in making Gatlinburg a major craft center and leading area for hand weaving in the country. Thus Pi Phi continues to contribute to the American culture. Winogene Redding returned to assume the duties of Weaving Supervisor and Designer. Gene was the first De-signer and even helped to name the project "Arrowcraft." A report of her years at Settlement School reads like a pioneer story. Gene had 54 of the best weavers busy this winter and called on more when the designs were ready for quantity production in anticipation of the fall sales. About 14 newly designed articles were ready for Convention and the delegates were most complimentary in their comments. Our former Designer, Mrs. Tina McMorran, dropped in at Arrowcraft now and then during the coffee break and kept up her contacts with the staff at Guild meetings. Elizabeth Rue, the friendly Arrowcraft Manager, met at Convention many of the officers from the 234 clubs which ordered from Arrowcraft Shop. This was a happy experience for these clubs furnish the principal markets for the mountain handcrafts. The tourist trade at Gatlinburg continued as visitors came to the Smokies in the fall, spring and summer months. The Arrowcraft Shop remained open at night during the summer tourist season. Most Pi Phis came to the Shop when in the Burg and Mrs. Rue was pleased to meet them when possible; however she was always ready to put them in touch with Mrs. Mueller, the Director, who could arrange a tour of the grounds. The local mountain girls served in the shop most capably. Arrowcraft had an exhibit at the Craftsman's Fair at Asheville. Next year the Fair will return to Gatlinburg. The newly revised Manual for Chapter and Club Settlement will be ready for fall and each chairman is urged to become familiar with the contents. There will be some new items on the Arrowcraft price list. Settlement School note paper with etchings of Health Center and Arrowcraft Shop will sell at ten for 5(4. An attractive addition to the Arrowcraft sales will be blue sacks imprinted in wine with the Arrowcraft trademark. These will come in three sizes. The Cook Books were ready in November; in less than six months 10,000 copies were sold. The second edition is ready for shipment and with a systematic plan of contacting the membership, clubs should have even larger sales of the book. Mrs. Emily Cantwell, the new Arrowcraft bookkeeper, reported more clubs paid by invoice. It is obvious the reason this request was made last year. Arrowcraft must meet the monthly bills and if all waited until May 31 to settle their accounts, this would be impossible. There are other ways in which clubs can help. Care should be taken not to over-order since this takes stock from other clubs when needed and leaves Arrowcraft in difficulty when re-turned after the holidays. Also, clubs should note there are some articles which cannot be returned. Neither can the club order be filled and mailed to various addresses. This demands too much time from the girls during the rush period and requires too much in the way of shipping sup-plies. Pi Phi owes a debt of gratitude to the clubs which had the courage to step forward and do their best. The following 22 clubs deserve special mention for these bought and paid for at least $1000 worth of Arrowcraft during the past fiscal year. Northern New Jersey.$2809.97 Kansas City, Mo $1287.58 Champaign-Urbana 2601.59 Dallas 1269.98 Houston 2400.09 Milwaukee 1167.44 Oklahoma City 2171.24 Arlington Heights 1156.00 Pasadena 2065.52 Cleveland East 1149.90 Denver 2014.10 Palo Alto 1105.52 Pittsburgh 1996.43 Fayetteville 1105.43 Tulsa 1909.34 Topeka 1079.73 Lincoln 1482.38 Portland, Ore 1066.23 Ames 1352.17 Madison 1055.39 South Bend 1351.63 Albuquerque 1015.68 The efforts of the other 212 clubs contributed to the success of Arrowcraft in securing a market for the mountain handcrafts. During the last 5 years, Pi Phi has paid THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 55 $276,556.24 to Craftsmen. One of life's greatest dividends is the feeling we have helped others in some way. When we sell Arrowcraft, we sell quality. Others may imitate but none duplicate! Facts and Figures All investments require money. It is gratifying to record that approximately 50 groups sizably increased their annual gifts to the Settlement School. This was a step towards overcoming inflation. Someone has said inflation is the art of cutting a dollar bill in half without touching the paper. Recent figures state that $1 out of 5 is eaten up by inflation. This means that what $4 bought 10 years ago, now costs $5. This also means that group gifts, which this year were the same as that given a decade ago, did not accomplish as much at Settlement School. The Committee gratefully received gifts for Settlement School from 102 chapters; this means there was only one which did not respond. Surely this year the chapters can be 100% which will be an achievement. The Clubs in the following Provinces were 100% in support of the national philanthropy: Beta Eta Mu Gamma Theta Xi Epsilon Lambda Pi The active chapters invested $2562.47 this year in Settlement School. This was an increase of $256.98 over the previous year. The alumnae clubs added $9359.45 which was a gain of $505.28. Texas Beta joined the ranks of chapters sending $100 or more; the other three have been regular members of the $100 club. Texas I' $150.00 Texas A $100.00 Texas B $100.00 Missouri B $100.00 The following 10 clubs invested $150 or more during 1957-58; those marked (*) made substantial increases over the previous year. St. Louis $800.00 *Pasadena $350.00 Cleveland East 510.00 Philadelphia 235.00 Kansas City, Mo 500.00 Milwaukee 225.00 *North Shore, Ill 500.00 Indianapolis 220.00 *Los Angeles 400.00 Denver, Sr 150.00 The above sums were increased by $9,048.18 from the Magazine Agency. This was $94.57 less. Elsewhere is printed the report which will give proper recognition to the faithful chairmen. Well executed plans could bring bigger returns next year. Many sent Christmas gifts to the School and Health Center. Boxes of good clothing were received and distributed as the need arose. At Convention $72.50 was collected for books in the Grace Coolidge Library at Settlement School, This gift was in memory of. Mrs. Coolidge who lived inMassachusetts and had served as a Province officer. Mrs. Mueller will supervise the selection of the needed books. More Pi Phis are realizing that it is appropriate to send gifts to the Settlement School treasurer in memory of friends who were members of the fraternity. Upon receipt of the contribution to the Memorial Fund, a suitable card is sent to the family. This fund was spent many times over, that is, in the minds of the Committee. A real attempt is made to choose very special purchases with this money and since there are so many places to use it, careful thought must be used. Another deep freeze would be a useful addition since the garden and chickens soon fill the one at Staff House. A station wagon could well replace the 1951 car; however there are some items high up on the Wishing List which require that the Fund should grow. Legacies have not been stressed too much in recent years; however to remember Settlement School in a will is one way to invest in the future. These gifts have been used for major improvements or building. This year the bequest from the Marian Stoner Huey estate was received and it is hoped that too much time will not elapse before the Joanna King Hempsted estate can be settled. A legal formwill appear in the ARROW as a reminder of this opportunity to invest in a living memorial. The above figures reveal vast investments of time, talents, and efforts on the part of many members in order to give substantial support to Settlement School. In spite of the generous gifts sent by a number of loyal groups, it should be called to attention that approXimately $30,000 in discounts went INTO the club treasuries from Arrowcraft sales and that little over $9,000 was sent FROM the clubs to support Settlement School. It would appear that instead of supporting Settlement School, some clubs were counting on the Settlement School products to support the local club and its projects. This is an arresting thought. As Lois Finger, the new chairman for Settlement School Publicity, stated so well in the fall letter to Pi Phi groups: "When you contribute to Settlement School, you do not contribute to Arrowcraft. Settlement School contributions go to maintain the buildings and grounds; to pay the salaries of our maintenance people, our teachers, and our staff; and to support the Health Center. You contribute to Arrowcraft, and so to the welfare of the mountain people, when you buy and sell Arrowcraft articles. When you hold Arrow-craft sales and contribute the net profits of that sale, you are contributing to ALL of the work at Gatlinburg." Unexpected demands were made on the Settlement School funds. This winter, Gatlinburg endured the longest and coldest period it has experienced in years. This required extra fuel and repair of pipes which burst after 30 years of service. At the end of the fiscal year, a water heater had to be replaced before Summer Workshop. Teachers' Cottage must be painted for the first time in six years. From now on, it would seem wise to paint one of the buildings each year. Fortunately paint holds up well in the Burg. Committee agreed some time ago it would never again tax the purse by painting everything at once. It is evident Committee must face surprises as well as inflation. Louise Dobler retired from the Committee after serving a term of 5 years as Publicity Chairman. She will be missed in many ways but one thing sure, she will be working for Settlement School and Arrowcraft in Everett, Washington. Smart program chairmen in that area should invite her to present their Settlement School program. Helen Russell joined the Committee to serve as Chairman of Slide Distribution. Helen brings a fine background of fraternity service as a former Province officer and member of the Committee on Chaperons. Future The true test of successful investing is achievement over a period long enough to include varied experiences and conditions. Settlement School has stood the test of time. New and intriguing opportunities constantly come to Pi Phi. The Chamber of Commerce in Gatlinburg, recognizing the ability of the Director of the Settlement School, elected her to be the president of that important civic organization. In addition to her strenuous schedule at Settlement School, Marion found time to participate in the Garden Club, PTA and various other groups. It is a challenge to realize that 5 girls, who wished to be in the dorm next year, must be refused. . . . The Arrow-craft "cottage industry" can demonstrate even more effectively to foreign visitors what can be done to help people help themselves. . . The same improved housing facilities for Workshop could afford greater use in the educational craft program. . . . Pi Phi must face the fact that its influence through this channel is making a significant contribution to American culture and that its influence is ever expanding. Future plans must be flexible and forward looking to make the best use of the Settlement School for education, health service and crafts. Your Settlement School Committee appreciates the trust you place in us. We assure you of our sincere belief in the soundness of your investment and foresee many opportunities for increased dividends.

The vast part of the Smokies lies within an easy day's drive of more than half of the nation's population. Actually, Gatlinburg is a two-mile long village of less than two thousand population at the junction of highways 73 and 441. These high-ways lead to: Loafing amid mountain splendor Fishing in crystal clear streams Hiking to skyline lookout points Trail riding to unopened valleys Gatlinburg And SETTLEMENT SCHOOL. Gatlinburg is a tourist town with 'approximately ninety motels and four hotels; a convention town with an auditorium with seating capacity of two thousand. The area has long been recognized for its many crafts. Settlement School is in the heart of Gatlinburg at the junction of the two highways. Even though we mingle with the towns-people, much of our activity is with the rural folks. This is also a land of superlatives with its lush vegetation and natural beauty. The place where we live is easy enough to find yes, easy to find, but difficult to forget! Here one finds the old, the new! Gatlinburg area is a combination of yesterday and today. We have neon signs, swimming pools, modern motels and hotels, many shops in the burg; and not too distant there are waterfalls, swimming holes, looms and log cabins. Pi Beta Phi memorial to our Founders is in the midst of such an area. It is a challenge to Pi Beta Phi to meet these changes as they arise. We trust that these changes from yesterday to to-morrow will be progressive. Due to all these attractions, there are many visitors, many of whom are Pi Phis. If you ever come this way, the Settlement School WELCOME MAT is out to each of you. Arrowcraft Coming in on either highway one soon sees the Arrow-craft Shop. Undoubtedly this is our largest contact with Pi Beta Phis everywhere. Manager Elizabeth Rue greets folks whenever possible. Pi Phis can be proud of the splendid record of their Alumni Clubs the nucleus of Arrowcraft business. With the many successful sales con-ducted by our Settlement School chairmen and helpers their slogan could be "the reward of a thing well done is to have done it !" North, South, East, and West you have done it! Many thanks to each of you. The new price lists will picture many of the new articles. Chairmen will doubtless have trouble choosing there is such a large variety. The Cookbooks have sold well, being in the second printing (10,000 each printing) in less than a year. Several changes in personnel were made at Arrowcraft Gene Redding returned as designer, having been away since 1945. As a consequence there are many new designs. Gene succeeded Tina McMorran who is now retired and free-lancing in her home with weaving specialties. Edna Cook, who served as salesgirl or assistant to the weaving designer for ten years, was married and lives in Detroit. Faye Cook succeeds her sister. Emily Cantwell is now bookkeeper, succeeding Eunice Cole. Nella Cook Hill, Nadine Grooms, Charlotte Moyer, and Susie Maples complete the staff. Mrs. McCutchan continues to sell Arrowcraft in the Mountain View lobby. Health Center Perhaps the biggest event at Health Center was the initiation of our nurse Marjorie Chalmers at Convention. We are happy to have Marjorie wearing the Arrow. To summarize her work one might say it is preventive a gradual change from years past. This includes the maternaland infant clinics, preschool clinic, T.B. x-ray clinic, physical examinations and inspections in all the rooms, follow-ups when necessary, and inoculations. Community Projects We believe that good public relations make for better community service and community service is one of our missions in life. Several staff members participate in one or more projects, among them Community Chest, Civil Defense, Committees of the churches, Scout counciling, Chamber of Commerce president, P.T.A., and Garden Club vice-president. Dormitories The dormitory part of our program is perhaps the most challenging activity at Settlement School because of its far-reaching scope. Many of the results are immeasurable. Fifteen children (eight boys, seven girls) completed the school year in our dormitory. Several were good students, several very poor. Naturally, I am concerned about the latter. A trade school might be the answer. Not having that, it is difficult to convince them that an education is important. Three dormitory girls made Beta Club, one boy and one girl were on Student Council, and three were on the football squad. One girl paid for music lessons by doing extra chores. A dormitory Halloween party with guests, a Christmas party with gift exchange, Valentine party, Class party, and picnic were the larger events during the year. There was evidence of dormitory "spirit." Two girls came back during the summer to chat. Linda said "'Gee, I sure do miss this place !" The other replied "Me, too." Dwight has lived in our dormitory three years, going to Pi Beta Phi high school. His home is twelve miles out in Wear's Valley. Dwight loves the outdoors, and is a dreamer, a young poet. When asked what he was doing on his vacation, he replied, "just settin'." I know he would "just set" as much as possible. The following is an ex-ample of his dreaming (he says he wrote this in algebra class) : THE WANDERER I walk this winding, upward path That few human feet have trod, Wonderous beauty all around, Created by the hand of God. And as, alone, I walk along I think of things I've left behind And how the Lord looks down on me By giving me this peace of mind. Across the way the sun now shines, Across the glen a bird now sings ; Through the tall green hickory trees A frisky little squirrel swings. The day grows older with each passing hour, The sun climbs higher, so do I ; To the top of the towering peak I climb, To the top of the tower, into the sky. From this point I look about And wonder more upon the sight; Far out across the tree-clad hills A great bald eagle makes his flight ; To the west and north is a man-scarred land With cities, factories, smoke, and noise; To the south and east lies God's great land, Wild with freedom, love, and joys. I may wander far and near But when my heart beat cloth cease, 'Tis here I want my body laid To rest in quiet, solemn peace. -DWIGHT DAVENPORT One day each week two music teachers give private piano lessons in Teachers and Stuart dormitories thus adding a bit of culture to our program. School Again Pi Beta Phi school was rated grade "A" for the THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 61 year. There are approximately one hundred seventy-five high school students with a graduating class of forty. Pi Beta Phi provided the Arts and Crafts, Woodcraft (two classes), Music, Physical Education, and Health Center with a full-time nurse. Hiring the Physical Education instructor is to be discontinued this year '58-'59. Tennessee schools rate very low in the nation, and our Sevier County very low in the state. So, there is still much room for improvement. The much-needed new lunch room has been added to the County gymnasium and is to be ready for school in September. Anna Belle Lee, who graduated from the University of Tennessee in June, is to teach Arts and Crafts for '58-'59. Mrs. Walter Enlow is to teach Music, and Carl Huskey teaches Woodcraft. One rural school, The Glades, is the only one-room school in our twelve mile area. Gradually they are disappearing; however, there are still eleven in the county. Farm To call our gardening and chicken-raising a farm is a misnomer. Actually much of our acreage is not tillable. There is considerable wooded land. Most of the garden produce finds its way to our table, directly or via the freezer. Richard Watson has been with us about eight years ,as farmer. His avocation is the ministry. Baptist, of course! Maintenance This could well be termed the most important department of all. There is much to maintain 78 acres, 12 buildings. Honestly, there is hardly a day that there is not some repair, somewhere. Having the second highest rainfall in the United States, there is much water damage. Much of the repair is negative. If it were not done, the result would be "sorry." Orlie Watson takes pride in the various lines of duty through his thirty years at Settlement School. He is carpenter, plumber, janitor, painter all in one day. Neal works with Orlie wherever duty calls. He, too, could be called "handyman." Orlie and Neal ship the many cartons of express from Arrowcraft to our Clubs. Weather never interferes. Pi Beta Phi University of Tennessee Workshop Marian Heard served in setting up Workshop, then pre-pared for leading the Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennessee Craft Tour to Europe for six weeks. Jane Glass continued to guide Workshop through its fourteenth season. Each year I am amazed at the individuals coming from all walks of life and various ages for a common purpose to study crafts. Each year the results seem to exceed the previous year in workmanship. Beginners surprise themselves and usually are quite proud of their work. There are several reasons why it is desirable to replace the temporary, make-shift dormitory in the old white school building. Our sturdy red barn could be converted to fill this need. This improvement for Settlement School would have untold possibilities with other projects, both in housing and workshops with multiple-purpose rooms. This could be kept on an educational level thus maintaining the goal of our Founders. Pi Beta Phis everywhere should be proud of this evidence here at Settlement School evidence of many hours and years of tireless and devoted effort of many of their members. Staff Starting my fifth year as Settlement School director I actually have a "queer" feeling. Why? Because for thefirst time I have a complete staff at the beginning of school. Even though several have years of service to their credit, usually someone is making or about to make a change. Sharon Dexter, Illinois Zeta, has recently come to serve as assistant to the director. I am sure Sharon will become very valuable to Settlement School. Ruth Shantz Spelman, Illinois Epsilon, has been with us a year as housemother, literally filling a need with the dormitory children. Gene Redding's return as designer at Arrowcraft is a homecoming because she was here sixteen out of twenty years-1925-1945. Susie Maples assists Gene Redding in the weaving department in addition to part-time selling at Arrowcraft. Mrs. Lela Adams is beginning her sixth year as cook for staff. She not only cooks, but supervises the deep freeze, canning and jelly making. Something New In June the Southern Highland Guild sponsored a three-day weaving workshop at our school. We were happy to serve as hosts for this educational project of the Guild. Approximately sixty attended. The Guild is planning future workshops in other crafts. For the first time in eight years the Southern Highland Guild Fair is to be in Gatlinburg in 1959. This is an event that many follow. If you have never been to the Craftsman's Fair, that would be a wonderful opportunity to see craftsmen at work, and to buy choice pieces. Experts in over forty crafts bring their displays and sales during the five-day period in late July. Of course, our, Arrowcraft shop sells and exhibits. Theatres Good entertainment for the tourists was available during the summer. Mr. John Richards brought his company from the New York American Academy of Dramatic Art for the twelfth season. The high school auditorium has been the location of this so-called Gateway Theatre. As usual a repertory of five plays was offered "Bus Stop," "Street Car Named Desire," "Come Back Little Sheba," "Out-ward Bound," "Mouse Trap." The Old Timers met again for their annual Harp Singing and celebration the last Saturday in June. "Chucky Jack" depicting the early history of Tennessee completed its third season as an outdoor pageant in a natural setting four miles east of Gatlinburg. Gifts Words are inadequate to express our appreciation of the many gifts to Settlement School gifts for the dormitories, Health Center, Christmas, clothing and books. All these gifts have been listed elsewhere. Again, I wish to extend our appreciation to each donor. It is heartening to receive them. When these gifts from everywhere arrive one realizes the magnitude of this project of Pi Beta Phi. Thank you To Grand Council, to Settlement School Committee, to Province Officers, to the many Pi Phis everywhere I extend a great big THANK YOU for your cooperation in helping to make this project something of which our Founders would be proud. Our slogan might be: "There is hope for the future And help in the past But for WORK There is only TODAY" Respectfully submitted, MARION W. MUELLER, Director Pi Beta Phi Settlement School
