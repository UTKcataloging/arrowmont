Canada. The 1962 mmittee shipped all their files here where they were ven a thorough cleaning, and an inventory was made, More shipping them on to the members of the new cornittee. The procedure notebooks and reports submitted by e 1962 committee were excellent and will be of great due in this year's planning. We continue to receive brochures from hotels in the nited States and in Canada, and invitations from Cham-.rs of Commerce or Convention Bureaus. Among the ter are communications from Honolulu, Vienna, Austria, aerto Rico and Nassau. Many places are not suitable and .nnot be considered, but further investigation is made of .e sites which seem to offer facilities which meet our reairements. The Grand Council makes the final decisions a the places to be investigated, and is responsible for the 'lection of the site of each convention. In November, a trip was made to Minneapolis, Chicago Id St. Louis for the purpose of investigating the Learning-41, the Edgewater Beach, and the Chase-Park Plaza Hotels. eports of these visits were submitted to the Grand Count and as a result, the Edgewater Beach Hotel was chosen ,r the 1966 convention. A tentative "hold" was put on dates in 1970 at the Broadmoor Hotel in Colorado Springs. Early in April a trip was arranged to visit the Empress Hotel in Victoria. En route, we stopped over at the Broad-moor in Colorado Springs for a tour of the hotel's facilities and a conference with the Executive Assistant Manager. The entire committee met together at the Empress and during our three day stay, we toured the hotel, met with the convention manager, made preliminary plans for the convention, and net also with the Pi Phis living in Victoria. This was a most successful meeting, for the members of the committee could continue to work together in night sessions after very full and busy days. At the request of the Grand President, we made chapter visits in March to Iowa Alpha, Iowa Beta and South Dakota Alpha. It was a pleasure to be able to assume this added responsibility this year, and once again to have personal contact with Pi Beta Phi chapters. The gracious hospitality of these chapters, and of the alumni whom it was our pleasure to meet, was greatly appreciated. It is a privilege to serve Pi Beta Phi in this capacity, and we wish to expsess our grateful appreciation to the members of the Grand Council, under whose direction it is a pleasure to work. HELEN ANDERSON LEWIS Settlement Lot 1912-1962 SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE Fifty-one years of Settlement School service and growth have passed. A sixth decade of hope and planning for the future has begun. Vision for the fraternity years ahead is centered, in part, upon the momentous decision that will be made at the 1964 Convention. At that time fraternity representatives will decide whether our present Memorial to The Founders of Pi Beta Phi, The Settlement School, is worthy of new focus, fresh investment, and perhaps a new name as a Centennial Project. In this last committee report to be available before that recision is made, we wish to combine last year's developments and traditional inclusions with a discussion of certain aspects of our present philanthropy as they pertain to the forthcoming Centennial decision. Surely 5 conscientious alumnre working 365 days a year for 5 continuous years acquire considerable knowledge of the past heritage, present trend and future potential of the project supervised. Thus we offer no apology for our discussion it is based on first-hand knowledge which we desire to share. This year, we just hope our readers will be many due to that important Centennial decision just ahead! Of the four projects to be considered on a fraternity-wide basis in 1964, one is allied to the Settlement School and the other three involve new endeavors. As the Settlement School proposal concerns an existing fraternity project, it seems imperative that convention delegates have a comprehensive understanding of our present Memorial as a basis for project discussion and vote. Thorough knowledge of what we have now is essential for a wise and sound decision regardless of the outcome. This is basic and logical. The Major Factor Education Approved at the 1910 Convention and in existence by 1912, the fraternity's educational philanthropy has a fascinating history. This is not the time for historical review except as it serves to point up various shifts in educational focus, and to clarify several aspects of the total endeavor not always understood. First, a point of semantics. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School is the proper name for the en-tire enterprise all of it. It is the name under which it was qualified as an educational institution and one that will undoubtedly continue until officially changed by the fraternity. The correct name to use when speaking of the school only is The Pi Beta Phi School. It leads to confusion to say settlement in this connection. It should be clear that the Pi Beta Phi School is and always has been a public school in the Sevier County School District. Gatlinburg does not have a separate school district. The Pi Beta Phi School is the only school in Gatlinburg, and the children who attend are about equal in number from within the town limits and from a wide-spread rural area. Another point to understand is that there have been shifting degrees of control and support throughout the school's history. In 1912-13 the fraternity and the county each provided separate, short, school sessions which made an awkward and inadequate situation. Then an agreement was reached that if the immediate community indicated its interest in better education by raising 2/3 of the cost of land for the school and the desired settlement, the fraternity would assume complete responsibility, build a new school, and provide good teachers. This was done and so began an arrangement that prevailed until 1943. During this period there was some county supplement. The fraternityadded a high school building in 1928 that marked the beginning of a 12-grade curriculum. In the 1930's, work on the adjacent Great Smokies National Park progressed rapidly. One result of this was an increase in the county's tax base, due mainly to the growth of tourist accommodations in Gatlinburg, a major park entrance and exit. The fraternity felt that the time had come for the county to resume basic education costs at the Pi Beta Phi School, and for the fraternity to assume a supplemental role by providing certain teachers which the county could not then, and still cannot now, afford tc employ on a county-wide basis. Since 1943, we have leased the playground and two school buildings to the county fol. $1 per year. During World War II years, student enrollment bulged there as elsewhere, and the. need for a new grade school and more adequate gymnasium-cafeteria facilities to meet rising standards became acute. The cost of land adjoining the fraternity school property was prohibitive for the county, and the fraternity agreed to assist these worthwhile efforts by deeding 1.8 acres for $1 to the county for school building purposes. In 1949, a new 50-year lease was negotiated to adjust to the deeded property, The expected buildings were erected shortly after. In 1961 both deed and lease were corrected to conform to a new fraternity land survey. These are the shifts in major educational support and control, from county to fraternity and back to county, and the related property adjustments. In the meantime, the Pi Beta Phi School changed from an elementary school to a combination elementary-high school, and due to a ,development this past year it is to become an elementary school again! For 3 years we have been hearing about consolidation of the Pi Beta Phi and Pitman Center High Schools. Rathel unexpectedly, the vote of necessary funds came late in 1962. Plans and building have moved quickly and the new school will open this fall at a new site outside Gatlin-burg. Thus the Pi Beta Phi School will serve grades 1-8 again. With the departure of the last high school class to graduate from the Pi Beta Phi School, it was a tribute to the Settlement School Director and to the Fraternity she represents that Marion Mueller was asked to give the Commencement Address! As women are not usually ac-corded such distinctive recognition, this was a special mark of esteem! Consolidation posed several pertinent questions for the fraternity that had to be decided rather quickly. Briefly, the decisions were: (1) terminate Woodworking classes fox high school boys; (2) continue Art-Crafts and Music classes for grades 1-8, on a part-time basis if possible; (3) continue dormitory program on a yearly evaluative basis; (4) continue school nurse services at the Pi Beta Phi and Glades Schools but not extend to the new high school and lastly, (5) terminate the Grace Coolidge Library in the high school building. In this latter regard, we gave all 1949 lease books to the county for distribution to the new high school or to the homerooms of the remaining elementary teachers. We shall establish a new Grace Coolidv Collection at the Staff House to replace the former high school library. This will permit better control than possible since 1943, and as this change has been anticipated for the past few years, all recent accessions have been care-fully retained by the Director! We are very grateful to the Pittsburgh Alumna. Club for its timely, special gift which will be used for appropriate bookcases to contain the new Collection and for the related, necessary redecoration of the 27 8 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI ving room. It is our belief that this plan to honor Mrs. :oolidge's memory is dignified, practical, and forward-)oking in its concept. Concerning our teachers, we are pleased to announce that le new Art and Crafts teacher will be Miss Mary Ruth mith who attended the Craft Workshop this summer and as just attained her master's degree at the University of 'ennessee. We regret a midsummer release-from-contract quested by Mr. Glenn Terry who had such fine Music lasses last year, and only hope a suitable replacement can e found at this late date. It was a sad decision to close 23-year association with Mr. Carl L. Huskey, the Woodiorking teacher. The integrity, knowledge and skill with Thich he taught the young men in his classes is deeply ppreciated by all fraternity members who have known him. (Tith these changes, Education at the Pi Beta Phi School is rought up-to-date. The current degree of educational suport there will be a factor in the Centennial decision. It is necessary to go back to the early 1940's to trace the evelopment of the latest Educational development The ;raft Workshop. As this is the one with which the Cen-Innial decision is concerned it is important to understand .ow and why it began. Along with the anticipated release f supervision and major support of the Pi Beta Phi chool, it was imperative to consider replacement of that ducational loss with a new endeavor that would retain the ducational status of the philanthropy and the property. ~wo independent surveys pointed the way. They noted hat the Arrowcraft project already had recognized, preerved and promoted the native crafts indigenous to the rea; that Arrowcraft's specialty, Handweaving, had proven is value in nation-wide interest within and outside the raternity; and recommended a new educational project at he adult level to increase craft artistry and skill and at the ame time provide meaningful recognition for a broadened, nigher educational interest. The University of Tennessee vhich has a strong Department of Related Art and Crafts within the College of Home Economics was approached nd became interested. After several years of discussion nd planning, the jointly-sponsored summer Craft Work-hops were launched in 1945. After 19 years, not only has he Craft Workshop come of age, it has grown to maturity with consistently increasing success, recognition and reputaion. There are several most interesting aspects of the Craft Workshop to note. A statistical compilation of 19 years of Craft Workshop s food for thought regarding extent of interest and appeal: Totals : 1945-63 Individual Students 1405 Class Enrollments 3698 States D.C. Represented 43 Foreign Countries Represented 12 Foreign Students Enrolled 27 Different Classes Offered 18 The co-sponsored Pi Phi-UT Craft Workshop is unique nd an unusual association of a university and a fraternity, specially when viewed from either traditional area of inerest. A recent university survey, while involving a few ainor adjustments, has provided assurance to Pi Beta Phi f continued interest in the present program and, more mportant, an interest in expanded services in connection with it. All national and province officers can attest to this mportant point for reflection in Centennial thinking, due o the talks given by Dean Lura M. Odland and Miss Ieard in Gatlinburg last summer. Past co-sponsoring relationships have always been most ,leasant, productive to progress and mutually helpful in very way. With this background and expressed interest a further expansion of co-sponsored education, fraternity aembers may be assured of continued valuable association. University standards for both undergraduate and grad-ate work have prevailed in all classes throughout Craft Workshop history. High standards that are maintained andconstantly improved are a mark of quality education in any field. This has been an important factor in the excellent reputation the Craft Workshop has attained, and would continue in all co-sponsored new endeavors. The college credit aspect should not be overlooked. This implication in co-sponsorship should be immediately evident. The present program or any future expanded pro-gram with college credit for people who want it would be impossible for the fraternity to achieve alone. The fraternity's prior investment in buildings already having an Art-Craft purpose should be mentioned. We cite particularly the last 3 buildings to be developed all having this focus in mind: (1) the Staff House in 1952 for better resident and instructional staff housing plus better kitchen-dining facilities to handle 75 people easily; (2) the Red Barn renovated in 1959 to replace the old schoolhouse dormitory, plus two meeting rooms; (3) the Weaving Studio in 1962 to provide our first year-around classroom. These are existing assets. When the planned Ceramics Wing can be afforded for the Weaving Studio, there will be two classrooms. For minimum year-around facilities, office space and 4 more classrooms will be needed before -withdrawal from the Pi Beta Phi School rooms. Considering what we already have, six new rooms are not many to need for conversion. The fraternity also has an existing asset in Art-Craft equipment. A fair estimate of this value is approximately $16,000. Some new equipment would be needed, of course, for year-around services but such expense should not be excessive. All in all, the fraternity has a very good and sound prior Art-Craft investment at the Settlement School upon which to build a new philanthropic program. One-week concentrated Craft Workshop courses (3) were a successful experiment this past summer and will probably be offered again in 1964. This kind of class had considerable appeal, we learned, for people having just two weeks for combined work-vacation-travel. It might have co-sponsor and single-sponsor implications for special purpose groups several times during the year. Specific planning of what, when, and for whom should follow the decision, however, not precede it. We can only analyse and explore for the present. The Pi Beta Phi-sponsored classes certainly need discussion on an existing and a projected basis. These classes began in 1959 after the Red Barn became available. More were requested the next year, and during the past year 7 different adult classes met one or more times a week, over a several month time span to conclude all of them. Such classes could be stretched out or made more concentrated at will. Some could even be offered for children in after-school hours or on Saturdays. There are many talented and creative craft people living in the area and they have provided the instruction. These classes have been excellent public relations, with social overtones that are good for the fraternity too. Concentrated one-day workshops or a series of lectures could be planned for organizations having a related craft interest, many of whom hold regular conventions in Gatlinburg. Educational activities sponsored by Pi Beta Phi would certainly have an important place in the overall expanded program. As with co-sponsored developments, these too would have to be planned more specifically if the green light is given. The many values inherent in the Art-Craft field will be discussed in the Director's Report only this year. As this is a big subject in itself, it was previously planned that the two reports would not duplicate this material. Please refer to the Settlement School Director's Report in this same issue for these very important coverages. The desired correlation between a local project and a national project is extremely good for the Settlement School proposal if a little thought and research are given to it. That is the beauty of the proposition the variety of application that can be made. For example, consider a specific craft service for a specific age group, a specific THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 29 7 handicap group, mentally retarded children or mentally ill adults each of these in the local situation. Consider a new program for an established community agency, a new service for the local community center, or an annual subsidy for an existing craft program that limps along because of lack of funds for materials. Consider too a new, local Pi Phi Scholarship to a new national Pi Phi Craft School sponsored by a club or a province and even joint club-chapter. Consider an annual craft art show with cash awards for the best entries. Consider old folks homes those forgotten people who too often just sit and wait with no hope or interest. These thoughts are just to open the "thinking door" to the numerous opportunities that are feasible and characteristic of this comparatively new field for interest and service. It is very exciting to think about the many different ways 320 clubs and 109 chapters could develop a local project in direct relationship to this Centennial proposal! The fact of an existing resident personnel needing only a fraternity directive to place conversion in effect is an asset that should be remembered. In other words, since there is personnel already familiar with a trend in the same direction as the project proposal, a going concern for the 100th anniversary of Pi Beta Phi could easily be in effect when 1967 arrives. There would be no time lag to get ready to get set to go ! It is always interesting to know the Pi Phis attending the Craft Workshop each year. The 1963 winner of the Albuquerque Alumna Club Scholarship was Patricia Ann Hamilton, Chapter President of New Mexico Alpha. Sandra Kay Martin, Texas Delta, won the Virginia Alpha Craft Work-shop Scholarship. The Graduate Assistant Scholarships awarded to Pi Phis were won by Sheila Smith of Manitoba Alpha and Margaret Miller of Indiana Zeta, If only more Pi Phi actives from near and far could enjoy this fraternity experience together every summer as these four girls did! Other Pi Phis enjoying the experience were Lorine Pruette, Ph.D. Tennessee Alpha; Ruth Spelman Illinois Epsilon; Marion Mueller Indiana Gamma. Marian G. Heard, Professor of Craft Design at UT and Convention Initiate in 1954, completed her 17th year as most capable, hard working Director of the Craft Workshop. The fraternity owes her and her staff a great debt for another fine year of leader-ship. As we conclude the report and direction of the Pi Beta Phi School and the Craft Workshop, it is worth remembering that twelve girls' concern for Education first brought our Founders together. It was singularly fitting that the fraternity's 50th year Memorial to them should be an education service, The Settlement School. It would be even more fitting if the 100th year Memorial could continue an educational purpose by building upon a past heritage and investment to establish a new kind of school one that is more specialized, creative, and an increasingly needed educational service in the increasingly automated society of the present and fore-seeable future. The Health Center The health work at the Settlement School was 43 years old this year. It was another fine year though somewhat different than usual in that the work done there was by two nurses instead of one! Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers, Illinois B-A, retired on December 1 after 27 continuous years of devoted and capable service. Brenda Allison, R.N., arrived on November 10 for several weeks of on-spot training with Marjorie before assuming sole responsibility which she has done most ably ever since. As usual, physical examinations were given to all children at the Pi Beta Phi and Glades Schools. Audiometer tests were given to children in the 2nd, 4th and 6th grades. Measles, mumps and chicken pox were prevalent during the school year, and almost 40% of the student body was absent at one time with influenza. Referrals were varied speech, eye and hearing defects, retardation, a severe case ofstrabismus, and spinal abnormality. The Friday Well-Baby Clinics continue and are especially well attended in good weather. The committee was astounded to learn that during the annual meeting, 30 children attended one Friday and 29 the other. The Health Center was a noisy place those days but good to witness! Various chapters of Sigma Phi Gamma sent a total of $135 for the Corrective Fund of the Health Center. As a rule though not always, most of the indigent cases requiring corrective treatment can be handled from these welcome contributions. Used clothing has been a special need this year. Also we like to keep the Loan Cupboard filled and not bare! We asked Nurse Brenda what she needed most and she replied: "Little boys' pants up to size 6, little girls' dresses up to size 6, good used shoes, and baby clothes." Jackets for children are welcome also. If any Pi Phi has surplus clothing of this kind, please send it to Miss Allison at the Health Center where it will be greatly appreciated. The statistical service record for the year is as follows: Field visits 324 Office calls 3789 Service given 3439 Small pox vaccinations 170 Typhoid injections 572 Triple vaccine (diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus) 276 Salk vaccine 333 Sabin oral vaccine 8 Tetanus toxoid 66 Therapeutic injections 211 Tuberculin tests 408 Chest X-rays 369 Physical examinations and inspections 1222 Audiometer tests 189 Teacher-Nurse conferences 321 Health Talks 31 Family conferences 269 Newspaper articles ... . 14 The role of the Jennie Nicol Health Center in a new kind of school would need thought, and there might be merit to continuing for these reasons. The cost to continue would mainly be the annual salary of one nurse as at present. From one person's services would come three benefits: continued protection to the fraternity of having a resident nurse in a new year-around school; continued service available to the community where our health work began, where many indigent families still rely on it and where this new school would still be; and continued service to the children of the adjacent school bearing the Pi Beta Phi name. Public relations would be implicit in this decision, as would the Jennie Nicol name within the fraternity. The Dormitory Program As stated earlier, this program will henceforth be evaluated annually due to the departure of high school students from the Pi Beta Phi School. It is impossible to foresee all effects but there is no doubt that attending school 5 miles away will bring changes. Thus the decision to examine it closely in the next year or two. There has been a dormitory program at the Settlement School since 1919, and the total number of young people benefited by it is approximately 650. This is such a personal guidance program that it is always difficult to state its values simply. Briefly, they include the whole range of young people's problems everywhere: right companionship, sufficient and proper food to grow on, privacy, need for supervised study, encouragement to finish high school and participate in worthwhile activities, guidance in earning money, a good private talk now and then, and so on. Mrs. Mueller says this is the most challenging part of her work, and yet it is least suitable to wide publicity. Accepted students pay $7 a month and augment this token fee with several hours of work each week, so there are mutual benefits. In the main, however, this program is subsidized by annual contributions, Magazine commissions and Arrow-craft net income, together with special gifts which augment. Even if evaluation should point the way to conclusion, and further, if the Centennial project should come, we ques30 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Eon the wisdom of closing our dormitory doors completely. Surely the composite heart of Pi Beta Phi is large enough to make i-oom for a few most needy young people each year, whether or not we call it a standing program. Ruth Spelman completed her 5th year as capable, genial housemother for the girls at Stuart Dormitory and, most happily, will continue next year. Lela Adams will continue her dual work as matron of the boys' dormitory and Staff House cook. Marion Mueller, of course, will again fill her "challenging" role as program director most capably and attentively as she similarly fills each of her numerous and varied responsibilities. Brendel Fund income was used to provide music lessons for certain dorm students. The Alspaugh Scholarship ($200) was awarded to Ronnie Moore for advanced study in art. Unfortunately, three dormitory boys added their statistics to the national drop-out problem, due to factors beyond our control. Viewing the year as a whole, it was another worthwhile and productive year to add to those that have preceded it. The Arrowcraft Shop The new look at the Arrowcraft Shop this year concerned people! On November 15, Maria Hutchins Tate, Florida Beta, arrived to begin her duties as Manager. She has been warmly welcomed by both shop and resident staffs, and we hope she will be with us a long time. Wino-gene Redding who helped inaugurate the Arrowcraft project in 1926 retired in mid-May. She had 4 different employment periods as Weaving Designer, and her many years of interest and service at Arrowcraft are very appreciated. Mrs. Corinne Purdom arrived on June 10 to start her responsibilities as Weaving Designer, having a fine back-ground for this unique position which involves creative designing for quantity production. It is always nice to have continuing personnel: Elizabeth Rue, Iowa Gamma, as cordial Manager of the Mountain View Hotel Shop, Eunice Cole as Bookkeeper, Nella Hill as Assistant to Mrs. Purdom, Faye Cook as Head of Shipping assisted by Gene Hembree, and Shirley Roberts and June Cook as salesgirls. We have a very fine, competent and cooperative staff of 8 regular employees at the Arrowcraft Shop. Shelves and storage places are bulging with beautiful handweaving and other interesting crafts, ready and waiting for another busy fall shipping season. Alumnx. club orders are, and always have been, the mainstay of Arrowcraft. Again we wish to say "thank you" to every Pi Phi who individually or collectively continues to provide needed work for 60 to 70 weavers annually, as well as to provide sizable outlets for other craftsmen. There was a fine increase in club sales both in weaving and other crafts and this is encouraging. Stress should continue to be on weaving for this is the Arrowcraft specialty. While many smaller clubs participate magnificently in the Arrowcraft project, it has long been a "friendly competition" tradition to name those clubs remitting over $1000 for Arrowcraft products during the past years, as follows: Champaign-Urbana $3,313.28 San Antonio $1,445.36 Akron 2,479.77 Beaumont 1,416.09 Pittsburgh 2,237.74 Warren-Youngstown 1,361.98 North Shore 2,209.97 Albuquerque 1,353.68 Wichita 2,085.13 Indianapolis 1,333.57 Philadelphia-Main Ardmore 1,305.73 Line 1,823.47 Northern New Jersey Berkeley 1,768.38 1,227.90 Bloomfield Hills 1,742.16 Gary 1,127.51 Arlington Heights 1,726.89 Chattanooga 1,116.15 South Bend 1,678.54 Milwaukee 1,099.53 Oklahoma City 1,656.06 Fayetteville 1,053.27 Stillwater 1,635.79 Cleveland East 1,042.94 Columbus, Ohio . 1,620.03 South Hills 1,040.12 Denver 1,546.11 Baltimore 1,015.00 Schenectady 1,462.60 Harrisburg-Carlyle 1,006.68 Periodically it seems necessary to remind clubs and chapters to please pay their Arrowcraft bills promptly. (Our auditors scolded the committee rather severely aboutthat this year so it is our role to be the spokesman in this matter.) It helps most when bills are paid by invoice as soon as a shipment is received and checked. Next best is payment within 60 days from date of shipment. This can be stretched to 90 days if necessary. The rub comes when accounts are not paid in full by the end of the fiscal year (May 31), and worse, if carried for a year or more. It might clarify Arrowcraft's need for prompt payment to state that while clubs and chapters may charge, Arrow-craft may not! Everything must be paid for before it is shipped. We are all in this together and when there is real need for an extension of time, a written explanation will help. With understanding and cooperation, the present plan can be continued and we all can look forward to an even better year for Arrowcraft in 1963-64. Readers might like to know in advance of the 1964 Convention that it is our present understanding we may not have an Arrowcraft sale at Victoria next summer. So the plan is to have an extensive Arrowcraft Exhibit instead. That will be one convention where a notebook will be more valuable than a pocketbook! Other Information Of The Year There were fewer 100% Provinces in Contributions to the Settlement School this year compared to last 1 less among clubs and 5 less among chapters. We believe the May 31 end of fiscal year at the Settlement School to be a factor in this drop, and urge annual reminders of this dateline. 100% provinces this year were: Clubs Chapters Both Alpha Alpha Alpha Delta Beta Delta Eta Gamma Iota Iota Delta Xi Kappa Theta Pi South Xi Iota Omicron Mu Pi South Xi Pi Alumna. Club Contributions sent to the Settlement School Treasurer totaled $12,175.24, a very welcome in-crease of $635.71 over the previous year. In addition, certain clubs sent $197 to the Director for special use. This increased support and confidence is most heartening. In keeping with a friendly tradition, the record follows of those clubs giving $150 or over, with number of consecutive years since 1949 in parentheses: Pittsburgh $1,300.00 Schenectady $175.00 Kansas City (14) ... 1,000.00 Northern New jersey St. Louis (14) . .. 770.00 (3) 150.00 Cleveland East (2) 375.00 Philadelphia-Delco 150.00 North Shore (6) 367.00 Columbus, Ohio (2) . 150.00 Pasadena (6) 309.00 Arlington Heights (4) 150.00 Indianapolis (14) .. 270.00 .................. . Omaha 233.50 Everett (7) 150.00 Westchester Co. (4) . 200.00 South Coast, Calif. ... 150.00 Los Angeles 200.00 While regretting the loss of 6 clubs having started a nice sequence, we welcome an equal number of new clubs to the fold! The above 17 clubs gave 47% of total contributions this year. Many thanks to them as to the many other clubs who gave equally well and even more in pro-portion to their size. All clubs will be interested to learn of a change in Soaring Pigeon Awards next year. Hence-forth these awards for both club contributions and Arrow-craft remittances will be made on a basis of club member-ship for the year. The groupings to be used are: up through 24, 25-49, 50-74, 75-99, 100 and over. To equalize the total number of club and chapter awards, the latter will be increased to the 10 highest in chapter contributions. We believe these to be very good changes for these tokens of recognition and appreciation, even though club winners will be much more difficult to determine. From $3,136.55 received in Chapter Contributions by the Treasurer, part will be used for operating expenses and $1,560.77 will be added to the Settlement School Endowment Fund for a 1963 total of $81,744.18. As THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 31 this year's chapter gifts were $270.21 less than the prior year and involved 5 less 100% provinces, the May 31 fiscal year may again be a factor. Our thanks go to all chapters who donated on time and also to the 2 chapters giving $42.48 to the Director for special purposes. Honorable mention for chapters traditionally is for $100 or more. Chapters thus recognized, with consecutive years, are: Nevada A (2) $175.00 Missouri B (13) $100.00 Texas A. (2) 150.00 Nebraska B (2) 100.00 Texas I' (8) 150.00 Montana A 100.00 Alabama B (4) 100.00 In addition to the annual cash donations from clubs and chapters that are so essential, many Pi Phis make generous contributions to the Settlement School each year. Though individually recorded, such gifts may be designated for club or chapter credit if desired, and they provide personal tax exemptions. Many other gifts of goods, magazines, books, Christmas remembrances and TV or SH stamps were received. All are welcome and provide nice surprises! Magazine Commissions in the amount of $8,351.70 were received and we are very grateful to the Magazine Chair-men who worked so hard to attain this total. Two years ago magazine commissions were approaching equal status with club contributions, but since then they have dropped over $2,900-to our considerable financial concern. Is it too much to ask every Pi Phi to review her own magazine subscriptions in the light of fraternity loyalty? Memorial Fund gifts this year came to $325, of which $55 was from clubs honoring a deceased member. Instead of sending flowers, a contribution to this fund is a meaningful, fraternity way to express love and tribute. Notifications of two bequests to the Settlement School were received this year, with payments to be made following probate. One was a bequest from the will of Ruth Kathryn Shoudy, Washington Beta, in the amount of $500. The other was a legacy of $2,000 from the estate of Anna Marie DeCastello in honor of her mother, Anna Many DeCastello, a charter member of Iowa Sigma. Pi Beta Phi in the lives of both former members must have been very personal, sincere and longlasting and it is an honor for the Settlement School to be remembered in this way. The May L. Keller Award for the best chapter program on the Settlement School was awarded this year to Ruth Sullivan of Alabama Alpha. The committee always finds this a very interesting though diffi-:,alt selection to make, only wishing that every chapter sent its best program of the year for consideration. Improvements made at the Settlement School this year were: acoustical ceiling for the dining room, rewiring of Pollard Cottage, new art tables and renovation of the Emma Harper Turner building, air-conditioners for the Weaving Studio where classwork is a very warm activity, new screen doors at the Red Barn, various indoor and outside painting, a new hedge along Pi Phi lane, and new drainage tiling where needed. Then too, there is always this and that to fix! The changing status of real property owned by and providing so-called "competitive business" income for educational, religious and charitable institutions is well known. It extends across the land. Last year the Arrowcraft portion of the property was assessed for ad valorem taxes for the first time in its history. Thorough review of a 1962 state Supreme Court case involving a comparable situation was so convincing of this trend that to instigate an appeal would have been futile. Even though this tax is not prohibitive it marks a new status for that corner plot of the property. It also serves as a sharp reminder that no presenteducational or related-service endeavor may be released until something to take its place is firmly entrenched. The afterglow of that wonderful Smithsonian Institution Exhibit, the highlight of the Settlement School's 50th anniversary, was evidently bright throughout the fraternity all year. In retrospect it is still quite remarkable that The National Museum of the United States should pay a full month's tribute to Pi Beta Phi for its Arrowcraft and Craft Workshop phases of work at the Settlement School. There should be implications for the future as we reflect upon the stature of that recognition. The committee had another busy and interesting year. The Settlement School Program Guide was completed and sent to all chapters and clubs last fall. As this was planned for ready reference in program planning, we sincerely hope it is used and not just filed away! Secretary Lois Over-street Summers did a fine job with Minutes compiled in both Washington and Gatlinburg; she greatly assisted the chairman all through the year and also wrote numerous thank-you notes for the committee. Eloise Glazner Hensley compiled a fine new slides program (this is done every year), and had much correspondence to schedule this and the convention program among clubs and chapters for the best slides year ever recorded. Sally Bosman Schneiter came through her first year as Treasurer with flying colors, and is eager to receive at any time those nice envelopes containing checks! Sally Wild Gordon assumed her Publicity work with ease the Fall letter to clubs and chapters, Little Pigeon News articles, and distribution of large glossies for display and publicity purposes. The entire committee wishes to assist any club or chapter in every possible way. There is this reminder: when a specific date is involved for information, a slides program or publicity material, please write as early as possible. The fullness of the past year was made immeasurably easier and nicer by the assistance of all Grand Council members, but especially by the thoughtful and prompt guidance given by our adviser, Olivia Smith Moore. We also wish to thank her for another of her "little stock gifts" so quietly given for a third time. It is a very sincere pleasure to welcome Dorothy Cole-man Thorman, Illinois Epsilon, as the new Chairman of the Settlement School Committee. She brings a fine fraternity background to the position as former Iota Alumnae Province President and former Chairman of Manuals. This experience combined with her numerous personal abilities promise outstanding leadership in the important Settlement School years ahead. Close association with the Settlement School is a privilege the retiring chairman wishes might be shared by every Pi Phi. It has brought appreciation of just how much continuous fraternity loyalty and investment can accomplish. It has brought realization of the worth of a past heritage in planning a future course. When Libbie Brook Gaddis accepted the Settlement School for the Founders in 1918, she said, "We are overwhelmed when we think of the honor you have conferred upon us in permitting the Settlement School to stand as a Memorial to your Founders." With a fresh look at the words "to stand as a Memorial to your Founders," it has brought a strong conviction that the Centennial Project proposal for the Settlement School is more than something feasible and realistic, it is the right decision for the fraternity. It is a keeping of faith with the Founders of Pi Beta Phi that the Settlement School shall continue to stand in new ways to serve the educational needs of a changing society. HELEN MOFFETT RUSSELL, Chairman t THE ARROW OF P1 BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL DIRECTOR'S REPORT atlinburg The village of Gatlinburg borders the Great Smoky [ountain National Park, hence is ideally located to accom-Lodate many tourists. Since World War II the facilities ave increased to the extent that over six thousand tourists Lay obtain housing in one of many motels, or in one of le four hotels. Yet the census reports slightly over two sousand population for the village. Highways 441 and 73 rovide the route of scenic beauty as one approaches Gatnburg and remains the predominant attraction to the tea. In the heart of Gatlinburg on the Parkway (Highways 41 and 73), one notices the Pi Beta Phi Arrowcraft Shop, i Beta Phi-University of Tennessee Workshop, Health enter, and Settlement School signs. Entering the school the one leaves the frequently bumper-to-bumper traffic nd notes the Pi Beta Phi buildings. For an armchair tour f the grounds it is logical to stop at the Loom House ihich was completed in June of 1962. raft Workshops The Craft Center with one large wing accommodating pproximately thirty looms serves as weaving studio and lassroom during summer workshop. Adult craft classes wet there during the winter months. Classes in weaving, apestry weaving and rug making, jewelry, stitchery and ottery have proved very popular with students both locally nd from nearby towns including two from North Caroina and two from Georgia. Many have shown interest in uture craft classes. With the Prouty gift at 1962 Convention contributing oward a future ceramic wing, naturally our thoughts turn o the future possibilities. These admittedly are dreams at resent; however, I think we can honestly classify some of hese "possibilities" as "needs." Manpower and money are vasted in shifting from winter school setup to summer vorkshop and vice versa. Moving heavy equipment adds o the risk of breakage. Emphasis might well be directed therwise toward a permanent setup. Handcrafts are not new. Yes, Pi Phi pioneered in reiving weaving in this Appalachian area, yet crafts have ,een made since early history. The Bible refers to the wool and flax weaver "She maketh fine linen, and selleth t." Pottery also served for utilitarian purposes as well as conomic in Biblical times. Now crafts have an indispensable place in culture also. ['he religious motifs the madonna, the cross, crucifix, tar, and three kings are frequently used. At our Pi Phi workshops many beautiful crafts are produced by proessionals as well those who are attempting to acquire .n inner satisfaction with a craft as a sideline. There may )e a therapeutic value this summer a blind girl took )ottery; a soon-to-be retired doctor was apparently searchng for a future way of self-expression. The aesthetic -alue was obviously being sought by several. Art super-'isors came for refresher courses, students to complete Eegrees. Each year I am more proud of the final exhibit 'feces. Much credit for this attainment is given our Work-hop Director, Marian Heard, who for eighteen years has lemanded that there be a high standard of workmanship. Perhaps you are a Pi Phi, hoping to come to Workshop onetime (many express that wish), and wondering a bit bout the advantages of handcrafts. They may be summed ip briefly as follows: Crafts develop skill provide a creative outlet may be a form of recreation increase sensitiveness to surroundings and give dignity to common things frequently bring out unsuspected abilities furnish aesthetic satisfaction and are pathways to wonder and beauty that form a link between nature and art explain and help rationalize the machine bring the handicapped into better adjustments. The economic, aesthetic, educational and therapeutic values overlap into almost any craft program. Not many folks get into trouble while working. It's the leisure time or free time which must be watched. Handcrafts taken up as recreation may be the answer. According to mountaineer terminology I'm "right proud" of our summer Craft Workshop. It is amazing and inspiring to see so many students with such varied interests work for similar goals. In February or March workshop information is sent to each Alumnae Club and Active Chapter using Central Office addressograph listing. If your Club or Chapter does not receive a brochure and letter, kindly inform my office. Our sincere wish is that many more Pi Phis could participate in this nationally, and internationally-known project. Scholarships may be made available through Clubs and other sources. Through this endeavor there are end-less opportunities for Pi Phi to broaden the horizons at Settlement School. Arrowcraft Shop Our Arrowcraft Shop sells many different crafts from the Southern Highlands. Weaving still remains the specialty of the shop. With the many Club sales (small ones count, too !), there is great evidence of the loyalty of many Pi Phi members who not only give hours but years in this voluntary work. Settlement School staff is aware of this, and deep appreciation is extended to every Pi Phi who participates. In the Settlement School Chairman's report the results of sales will be given. Arrowcraft averages sixty weavers who bring their products to the shop for sale throughout the year. This represents a large sum which has an economic influence some weaving to supplement their husband's income, others making it their livelihood. Maria Lou Tate, Florida Beta, came as manager of Arrow-craft in November, and is proving most capable. June 10 (the first day of summer workshop) Corrine Purdom began her duties as weaving designer for Arrowcraft. This job is a difficult one to fill, yet with Corrine's Master's Degree in Weaving, gradually new items should appear. Since the price list is effective for one year, radical changes cannot be made mid-year. Perhaps one of the greatest honors that has ever come to Arrowcraft and our Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennessee Workshop was the invitation to display weaving in the Textile Division of the Smithsonian Institute for one month in 1962. Many Pi Phis who attended the Convention in Washington had the privilege of seeing this large exhibit in the Rotunda. The request for some of the weaving to be in a permanent collection at the Smithsonian was a compliment, indeed. Pi Phi standards are high and consequently rewarding. Hotel Arrowcraft Shop Elizabeth Rue, Iowa Gamma, continues as manager of the Mountain View Hotel Shop. Being semi-retired, she has developed many outside interests in the community and church. Health Center Our Jennie Nicol Health Center perhaps witnessed the greatest change Nurse Marjorie Chalmers having retired after twenty-seven years at Settlement School. In November Brenda Allison, R.N., from the University of Tennessee, accepted the challenge as replacement for much seniority. Brenda has done that very capably the key to success perhaps being a youthful viewpoint. Funds for a much-needed County Hospital are ap THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 33 proved. Approximately fifty beds will be a radical change from the six-bed clinic of a local physician in Gatlinburg. The hospital will be near the County seat approximately twelve miles from Gatlinburg. Gatlinburg School 1963 doubtless will be remembered as a year of many changes. Five miles east a new high school is scheduled for occupancy in late August. In 1937 the first four-year class graduated from Pi Beta Phi High School (the only Gatlinburg School). The high school annual The .Mountaineer with pictures of Pi Beta Phi High School appropriately had this caption: "For much longer than any of us can remember, these bells have regulated the days, where countless students have worked and worried and laughed and played and searched for knowledge." Over six hundred graduates have passed through the Pi Beta Phi Halls of Ivy. With the consolidation of nearby Pitman Center the new school will be known as Gatlinburg-Pitman High School. Pi Beta Phi will keep its name at the elementary school (grades 1-8) in Gatlinburg, and the Settlement School which includes thirteen buildings and over seventy acres of land. Emily Burchfiel Kile, a University of Tennessee graduate, taught Art and Crafts for Pi Phi during 1962-1963. Mary Ruth Smith, having acquired her Master's degree at the University of Tennessee is scheduled to teach Art and Crafts in 1963-1964. At this writing there is no replacement for Glenn Terry who developed an excellent music program last year. It was decided to discontinue the wood-working classes with the removal of the high school. The Dormitory Fifteen to twenty boys and girls were "living in" throughout the year. A few were eventually dropouts from school, hence from the dormitory. One of the cases was an eighth grade boy who was seventeen years old. Deplorable, indeed! Because he is a future citizen who will be rearing a family someday and voting in our democratic government. . . . There was a goodly number of honors to balance the score. These various honors captain of foot-ball, members of Student Council, parts in class plays, class officers perhaps are the only tangible evidence of accomplishments. However, those of us who work with the children literally "see" growth not only physically, but in character and personality. At graduation it was truly thrilling for a three-year dormitory boy to receive the award for the best all-round boy as chosen by the faculty; also for a freshman dormitory boy to receive the award (also as chosen by the faculty) for the most improvement. A four-year dormitory girl received the award for showing the best sportsmanship in basketball. Living in the dormitory is broadening experience for the students. It's character building to "keep hours" and assume responsibilities in addition to their school work. Our slogan is to be a good student first, then find time for other activities. (Needless to say, all do not attain their goal.) Ruth Spelman, a Golden Arrow Pi Phi from Illinois Epsilon, serves as housemother for the girls. The Red Barn The Red Barn continues to be popular with religious, philanthropic, and educational groups for retreats and workshops. The Owls' Nest and Little Pigeon Loft prove to be an attraction. Personnel All personnel is the same except for new staff rnembers mentioned previously. With the thirteen buildings and over seventy acres there is an endless amount of maintenance. Orlie Watson for over thirty-seven years with Settlement School is always ready for emergencies (and somehow, they have a way of coming at night). Neal, Zanley, and Richard Watson "don't even have time for fishing." It is a rare day that something doesn't have to be "fixed." The winter weather was most unusual, the coldest ever, with ten days of school missed (the time had to be made up before the end of the semester). In cold weather there is always much "busyness" preventing trouble. Gateway Theatre On this tour of the school grounds during the summer one notes a sign at the school building, saying "Gateway Theatre." John Richards has directed a young group of theatrical students from the American Academy of Drama in New York for seventeen summers. His repertoire of four or five plays is given in the school auditorium. Little Pigeon Alumni Club This Alumnae Club is fortunate to have approximately fourteen Pi Phis in the vicinity, hence has developed an increasing interest and loyalty to Settlement School. Evidence of this was the Evelyn Bishop Lounge in the Loom House which was dedicated in July 1962. This room was furnished with the Memorial Fund to which many local citizens as well as Pi Phis everywhere honored the first head resident of Settlement School. Lest We Forget Our Memorial to our Pi Beta Phi Founders is some-thing of which every Pi Beta Phi should be proud. By keeping alive the best of the past, it helps us tc build the future. Let us light TOMORROW with TODAY ! Respectfully submitted, MARION W. MUELLER, Director Accountants' Report Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Committee, Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, Gatlinburg, Tennessee. We have examined the balance sheet of Pi Beta Ph Settlement School as of May 31, 1963, and the relatec statements of income and expenses and fund balances fol the year then ended. Our examination was made in ac cordance with generally accepted auditing standards and except that we did not observe the procedures employec in ascertaining inventory quantities or make tests of the valuation thereof, it included such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures as we consid ered necessary in the circumstances. As the scope of our examination did not include ob servance of the inventory-taking or tests of the inventor] quantities or valuation thereof, and as we were unable t( satisfy ourselves by other means as to the amount at -whict the inventory is stated, we are not in a position to ex press an opinion upon the financial statements. However otherwise than as affected by the foregoing exception, i is our opinion that the statements have been prepared 1'1 accordance with generally accepted accounting principle applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding year.

We promptly put them all to work, and they responded beautifully. On the recommendation of our architect, Mr. James M. Battersby, AIA, of Knoxville, Illinois, we had (1) four round steel columns put in the northwest corner of the basement to shore up the beams and joists; (2) the floors on the first floor levelled and refinished; and (3) the east exterior wall brushed and repainted where the paint was peeling. Mrs. Hines, our hostess at Holt House, reports the refinished floors look lovely. We had sad news in the fact that we lost four trees to the dutch elm disease last summer. They have been removed, but will also have to be replaced. The kitchen cabinets have new hardware, which is the first since the original restoration. A Holt House sign has been placed on Broadway, the main street in Monmouth, thanks to the efforts of Cleone Barnes Rawson, the Monmouth member of our committee. We have had complaints about the lack of such a sign for many years, and are grateful for her work in securing per-mission to have one. At the fall meeting of the Holt House committee we hired Mrs. Ada Willer-Peterson, AID, of Chicago to help with the long range planning and redecorating of Holt House. We hope to repaper the dining room and Pine room this summer, and put up new curtains in both rooms. The decorator has sent sample boxes to the committee, from which they are to make their selection. Next year we hope to do the parlor and hall. Our aim is to have Holt House in A-1 condition by the Centennial in 1967. From May 1, 1962 to April 30, 1963 Holt House was used 128 times, 17 of them by Pi Phis. We have purposely kept the rentals low so more clubs and individuals would feel they could use it. In this way we feel it is helping to serve the purpose to which our Founders aspired. Many clubs use it as a regular meeting place, and we have had several wedding receptions this year. Forty-seven chapters and clubs have used the slides for programs this year, This is a record! If you haven't seen them, try to schedule them this fall. They are most interesting and informative, and a script accompanies them. Send your requests in early to Miss Margaret Dick, 288 Southmoreland, Decatur, Illinois. Pi Province North sent us 5 green stamp books, and with them plus some others we had, we were able to purchase a copper kitchen clock, and a large coffee maker. The latter delighted all the clubs, because they formerly had to furnish their own. Marion Keck Simmons sent four books which are quite an addition to our library. A 100% record of contributions last year from the active chapters was a first. Only 8 alumni clubs refrained from donating. We hope we will have 100% from both this year. Your contributions are necessary to keep Holt House in tip top shape. For those of you who have never visited Holt House, I hope someday you may. It is lovely, and the ideals it symbolizes are worth everything we can do to keep them going.

SHIRLEY JONES MANN Accountants' Report Holt House Committee, Pi Beta Phi, Galesburg, Illinois. We have examined the accompanying statement of fund balance of the Holt House Treasurer Pi Beta Phi, resulting from recorded cash transactions, for the year ended May 31, 1963. Our examination was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records, and such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. In our opinion, the accompanying statement presents fairly the fund balance of the Holt House Treasurer Pi Beta Phi at May 31, 1963, resulting from recorded cash transactions, and the receipts collected and expenses disbursed during the year then ended, on a basis consistent with that of the preceding year.

        8 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI ving room. It is our belief that this plan to honor Mrs. :oolidge's memory is dignified, practical, and forward-)oking in its concept. Concerning our teachers, we are pleased to announce that le new Art and Crafts teacher will be Miss Mary Ruth mith who attended the Craft Workshop this summer and as just attained her master's degree at the University of 'ennessee. We regret a midsummer release-from-contract quested by Mr. Glenn Terry who had such fine Music lasses last year, and only hope a suitable replacement can e found at this late date. It was a sad decision to close 23-year association with Mr. Carl L. Huskey, the Woodiorking teacher. The integrity, knowledge and skill with Thich he taught the young men in his classes is deeply ppreciated by all fraternity members who have known him. (Tith these changes, Education at the Pi Beta Phi School is rought up-to-date. The current degree of educational suport there will be a factor in the Centennial decision. It is necessary to go back to the early 1940's to trace the evelopment of the latest Educational development The ;raft Workshop. As this is the one with which the Cen-Innial decision is concerned it is important to understand .ow and why it began. Along with the anticipated release f supervision and major support of the Pi Beta Phi chool, it was imperative to consider replacement of that ducational loss with a new endeavor that would retain the ducational status of the philanthropy and the property. ~wo independent surveys pointed the way. They noted hat the Arrowcraft project already had recognized, preerved and promoted the native crafts indigenous to the rea; that Arrowcraft's specialty, Handweaving, had proven is value in nation-wide interest within and outside the raternity; and recommended a new educational project at he adult level to increase craft artistry and skill and at the ame time provide meaningful recognition for a broadened, nigher educational interest. The University of Tennessee vhich has a strong Department of Related Art and Crafts within the College of Home Economics was approached nd became interested. After several years of discussion nd planning, the jointly-sponsored summer Craft Work-hops were launched in 1945. After 19 years, not only has he Craft Workshop come of age, it has grown to maturity with consistently increasing success, recognition and reputaion. There are several most interesting aspects of the Craft Workshop to note. A statistical compilation of 19 years of Craft Workshop s food for thought regarding extent of interest and appeal: Totals : 1945-63 Individual Students 1405 Class Enrollments 3698 States D.C. Represented 43 Foreign Countries Represented 12 Foreign Students Enrolled 27 Different Classes Offered 18 The co-sponsored Pi Phi-UT Craft Workshop is unique nd an unusual association of a university and a fraternity, specially when viewed from either traditional area of inerest. A recent university survey, while involving a few ainor adjustments, has provided assurance to Pi Beta Phi f continued interest in the present program and, more mportant, an interest in expanded services in connection with it. All national and province officers can attest to this mportant point for reflection in Centennial thinking, due o the talks given by Dean Lura M. Odland and Miss Ieard in Gatlinburg last summer. Past co-sponsoring relationships have always been most ,leasant, productive to progress and mutually helpful in very way. With this background and expressed interest a further expansion of co-sponsored education, fraternity aembers may be assured of continued valuable association. University standards for both undergraduate and grad-ate work have prevailed in all classes throughout Craft Workshop history. High standards that are maintained andconstantly improved are a mark of quality education in any field. This has been an important factor in the excellent reputation the Craft Workshop has attained, and would continue in all co-sponsored new endeavors. The college credit aspect should not be overlooked. This implication in co-sponsorship should be immediately evident. The present program or any future expanded pro-gram with college credit for people who want it would be impossible for the fraternity to achieve alone. The fraternity's prior investment in buildings already having an Art-Craft purpose should be mentioned. We cite particularly the last 3 buildings to be developed all having this focus in mind: (1) the Staff House in 1952 for better resident and instructional staff housing plus better kitchen-dining facilities to handle 75 people easily; (2) the Red Barn renovated in 1959 to replace the old schoolhouse dormitory, plus two meeting rooms; (3) the Weaving Studio in 1962 to provide our first year-around classroom. These are existing assets. When the planned Ceramics Wing can be afforded for the Weaving Studio, there will be two classrooms. For minimum year-around facilities, office space and 4 more classrooms will be needed before -withdrawal from the Pi Beta Phi School rooms. Considering what we already have, six new rooms are not many to need for conversion. The fraternity also has an existing asset in Art-Craft equipment. A fair estimate of this value is approximately $16,000. Some new equipment would be needed, of course, for year-around services but such expense should not be excessive. All in all, the fraternity has a very good and sound prior Art-Craft investment at the Settlement School upon which to build a new philanthropic program. One-week concentrated Craft Workshop courses (3) were a successful experiment this past summer and will probably be offered again in 1964. This kind of class had considerable appeal, we learned, for people having just two weeks for combined work-vacation-travel. It might have co-sponsor and single-sponsor implications for special purpose groups several times during the year. Specific planning of what, when, and for whom should follow the decision, however, not precede it. We can only analyse and explore for the present. The Pi Beta Phi-sponsored classes certainly need discussion on an existing and a projected basis. These classes began in 1959 after the Red Barn became available. More were requested the next year, and during the past year 7 different adult classes met one or more times a week, over a several month time span to conclude all of them. Such classes could be stretched out or made more concentrated at will. Some could even be offered for children in after-school hours or on Saturdays. There are many talented and creative craft people living in the area and they have provided the instruction. These classes have been excellent public relations, with social overtones that are good for the fraternity too. Concentrated one-day workshops or a series of lectures could be planned for organizations having a related craft interest, many of whom hold regular conventions in Gatlinburg. Educational activities sponsored by Pi Beta Phi would certainly have an important place in the overall expanded program. As with co-sponsored developments, these too would have to be planned more specifically if the green light is given. The many values inherent in the Art-Craft field will be discussed in the Director's Report only this year. As this is a big subject in itself, it was previously planned that the two reports would not duplicate this material. Please refer to the Settlement School Director's Report in this same issue for these very important coverages. The desired correlation between a local project and a national project is extremely good for the Settlement School proposal if a little thought and research are given to it. That is the beauty of the proposition the variety of application that can be made. For example, consider a specific craft service for a specific age group, a specific THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 29 7 handicap group, mentally retarded children or mentally ill adults each of these in the local situation. Consider a new program for an established community agency, a new service for the local community center, or an annual subsidy for an existing craft program that limps along because of lack of funds for materials. Consider too a new, local Pi Phi Scholarship to a new national Pi Phi Craft School sponsored by a club or a province and even joint club-chapter. Consider an annual craft art show with cash awards for the best entries. Consider old folks homes those forgotten people who too often just sit and wait with no hope or interest. These thoughts are just to open the "thinking door" to the numerous opportunities that are feasible and characteristic of this comparatively new field for interest and service. It is very exciting to think about the many different ways 320 clubs and 109 chapters could develop a local project in direct relationship to this Centennial proposal! The fact of an existing resident personnel needing only a fraternity directive to place conversion in effect is an asset that should be remembered. In other words, since there is personnel already familiar with a trend in the same direction as the project proposal, a going concern for the 100th anniversary of Pi Beta Phi could easily be in effect when 1967 arrives. There would be no time lag to get ready to get set to go ! It is always interesting to know the Pi Phis attending the Craft Workshop each year. The 1963 winner of the Albuquerque Alumna Club Scholarship was Patricia Ann Hamilton, Chapter President of New Mexico Alpha. Sandra Kay Martin, Texas Delta, won the Virginia Alpha Craft Work-shop Scholarship. The Graduate Assistant Scholarships awarded to Pi Phis were won by Sheila Smith of Manitoba Alpha and Margaret Miller of Indiana Zeta, If only more Pi Phi actives from near and far could enjoy this fraternity experience together every summer as these four girls did! Other Pi Phis enjoying the experience were Lorine Pruette, Ph.D. Tennessee Alpha; Ruth Spelman Illinois Epsilon; Marion Mueller Indiana Gamma. Marian G. Heard, Professor of Craft Design at UT and Convention Initiate in 1954, completed her 17th year as most capable, hard working Director of the Craft Workshop. The fraternity owes her and her staff a great debt for another fine year of leader-ship. As we conclude the report and direction of the Pi Beta Phi School and the Craft Workshop, it is worth remembering that twelve girls' concern for Education first brought our Founders together. It was singularly fitting that the fraternity's 50th year Memorial to them should be an education service, The Settlement School. It would be even more fitting if the 100th year Memorial could continue an educational purpose by building upon a past heritage and investment to establish a new kind of school one that is more specialized, creative, and an increasingly needed educational service in the increasingly automated society of the present and fore-seeable future. The Health Center The health work at the Settlement School was 43 years old this year. It was another fine year though somewhat different than usual in that the work done there was by two nurses instead of one! Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers, Illinois B-A, retired on December 1 after 27 continuous years of devoted and capable service. Brenda Allison, R.N., arrived on November 10 for several weeks of on-spot training with Marjorie before assuming sole responsibility which she has done most ably ever since. As usual, physical examinations were given to all children at the Pi Beta Phi and Glades Schools. Audiometer tests were given to children in the 2nd, 4th and 6th grades. Measles, mumps and chicken pox were prevalent during the school year, and almost 40% of the student body was absent at one time with influenza. Referrals were varied speech, eye and hearing defects, retardation, a severe case ofstrabismus, and spinal abnormality. The Friday Well-Baby Clinics continue and are especially well attended in good weather. The committee was astounded to learn that during the annual meeting, 30 children attended one Friday and 29 the other. The Health Center was a noisy place those days but good to witness! Various chapters of Sigma Phi Gamma sent a total of $135 for the Corrective Fund of the Health Center. As a rule though not always, most of the indigent cases requiring corrective treatment can be handled from these welcome contributions. Used clothing has been a special need this year. Also we like to keep the Loan Cupboard filled and not bare! We asked Nurse Brenda what she needed most and she replied: "Little boys' pants up to size 6, little girls' dresses up to size 6, good used shoes, and baby clothes." Jackets for children are welcome also. If any Pi Phi has surplus clothing of this kind, please send it to Miss Allison at the Health Center where it will be greatly appreciated. The statistical service record for the year is as follows: Field visits 324 Office calls 3789 Service given 3439 Small pox vaccinations 170 Typhoid injections 572 Triple vaccine (diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus) 276 Salk vaccine 333 Sabin oral vaccine 8 Tetanus toxoid 66 Therapeutic injections 211 Tuberculin tests 408 Chest X-rays 369 Physical examinations and inspections 1222 Audiometer tests 189 Teacher-Nurse conferences 321 Health Talks 31 Family conferences 269 Newspaper articles ... . 14 The role of the Jennie Nicol Health Center in a new kind of school would need thought, and there might be merit to continuing for these reasons. The cost to continue would mainly be the annual salary of one nurse as at present. From one person's services would come three benefits: continued protection to the fraternity of having a resident nurse in a new year-around school; continued service available to the community where our health work began, where many indigent families still rely on it and where this new school would still be; and continued service to the children of the adjacent school bearing the Pi Beta Phi name. Public relations would be implicit in this decision, as would the Jennie Nicol name within the fraternity. The Dormitory Program As stated earlier, this program will henceforth be evaluated annually due to the departure of high school students from the Pi Beta Phi School. It is impossible to foresee all effects but there is no doubt that attending school 5 miles away will bring changes. Thus the decision to examine it closely in the next year or two. There has been a dormitory program at the Settlement School since 1919, and the total number of young people benefited by it is approximately 650. This is such a personal guidance program that it is always difficult to state its values simply. Briefly, they include the whole range of young people's problems everywhere: right companionship, sufficient and proper food to grow on, privacy, need for supervised study, encouragement to finish high school and participate in worthwhile activities, guidance in earning money, a good private talk now and then, and so on. Mrs. Mueller says this is the most challenging part of her work, and yet it is least suitable to wide publicity. Accepted students pay $7 a month and augment this token fee with several hours of work each week, so there are mutual benefits. In the main, however, this program is subsidized by annual contributions, Magazine commissions and Arrow-craft net income, together with special gifts which augment. Even if evaluation should point the way to conclusion, and further, if the Centennial project should come, we ques30 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Eon the wisdom of closing our dormitory doors completely. Surely the composite heart of Pi Beta Phi is large enough to make i-oom for a few most needy young people each year, whether or not we call it a standing program. Ruth Spelman completed her 5th year as capable, genial housemother for the girls at Stuart Dormitory and, most happily, will continue next year. Lela Adams will continue her dual work as matron of the boys' dormitory and Staff House cook. Marion Mueller, of course, will again fill her "challenging" role as program director most capably and attentively as she similarly fills each of her numerous and varied responsibilities. Brendel Fund income was used to provide music lessons for certain dorm students. The Alspaugh Scholarship ($200) was awarded to Ronnie Moore for advanced study in art. Unfortunately, three dormitory boys added their statistics to the national drop-out problem, due to factors beyond our control. Viewing the year as a whole, it was another worthwhile and productive year to add to those that have preceded it. The Arrowcraft Shop The new look at the Arrowcraft Shop this year concerned people! On November 15, Maria Hutchins Tate, Florida Beta, arrived to begin her duties as Manager. She has been warmly welcomed by both shop and resident staffs, and we hope she will be with us a long time. Wino-gene Redding who helped inaugurate the Arrowcraft project in 1926 retired in mid-May. She had 4 different employment periods as Weaving Designer, and her many years of interest and service at Arrowcraft are very appreciated. Mrs. Corinne Purdom arrived on June 10 to start her responsibilities as Weaving Designer, having a fine back-ground for this unique position which involves creative designing for quantity production. It is always nice to have continuing personnel: Elizabeth Rue, Iowa Gamma, as cordial Manager of the Mountain View Hotel Shop, Eunice Cole as Bookkeeper, Nella Hill as Assistant to Mrs. Purdom, Faye Cook as Head of Shipping assisted by Gene Hembree, and Shirley Roberts and June Cook as salesgirls. We have a very fine, competent and cooperative staff of 8 regular employees at the Arrowcraft Shop. Shelves and storage places are bulging with beautiful handweaving and other interesting crafts, ready and waiting for another busy fall shipping season. Alumnx. club orders are, and always have been, the mainstay of Arrowcraft. Again we wish to say "thank you" to every Pi Phi who individually or collectively continues to provide needed work for 60 to 70 weavers annually, as well as to provide sizable outlets for other craftsmen. There was a fine increase in club sales both in weaving and other crafts and this is encouraging. Stress should continue to be on weaving for this is the Arrowcraft specialty. While many smaller clubs participate magnificently in the Arrowcraft project, it has long been a "friendly competition" tradition to name those clubs remitting over $1000 for Arrowcraft products during the past years, as follows: Champaign-Urbana $3,313.28 San Antonio $1,445.36 Akron 2,479.77 Beaumont 1,416.09 Pittsburgh 2,237.74 Warren-Youngstown 1,361.98 North Shore 2,209.97 Albuquerque 1,353.68 Wichita 2,085.13 Indianapolis 1,333.57 Philadelphia-Main Ardmore 1,305.73 Line 1,823.47 Northern New Jersey Berkeley 1,768.38 1,227.90 Bloomfield Hills 1,742.16 Gary 1,127.51 Arlington Heights 1,726.89 Chattanooga 1,116.15 South Bend 1,678.54 Milwaukee 1,099.53 Oklahoma City 1,656.06 Fayetteville 1,053.27 Stillwater 1,635.79 Cleveland East 1,042.94 Columbus, Ohio . 1,620.03 South Hills 1,040.12 Denver 1,546.11 Baltimore 1,015.00 Schenectady 1,462.60 Harrisburg-Carlyle 1,006.68 Periodically it seems necessary to remind clubs and chapters to please pay their Arrowcraft bills promptly. (Our auditors scolded the committee rather severely aboutthat this year so it is our role to be the spokesman in this matter.) It helps most when bills are paid by invoice as soon as a shipment is received and checked. Next best is payment within 60 days from date of shipment. This can be stretched to 90 days if necessary. The rub comes when accounts are not paid in full by the end of the fiscal year (May 31), and worse, if carried for a year or more. It might clarify Arrowcraft's need for prompt payment to state that while clubs and chapters may charge, Arrow-craft may not! Everything must be paid for before it is shipped. We are all in this together and when there is real need for an extension of time, a written explanation will help. With understanding and cooperation, the present plan can be continued and we all can look forward to an even better year for Arrowcraft in 1963-64. Readers might like to know in advance of the 1964 Convention that it is our present understanding we may not have an Arrowcraft sale at Victoria next summer. So the plan is to have an extensive Arrowcraft Exhibit instead. That will be one convention where a notebook will be more valuable than a pocketbook! Other Information Of The Year There were fewer 100% Provinces in Contributions to the Settlement School this year compared to last 1 less among clubs and 5 less among chapters. We believe the May 31 end of fiscal year at the Settlement School to be a factor in this drop, and urge annual reminders of this dateline. 100% provinces this year were: Clubs Chapters Both Alpha Alpha Alpha Delta Beta Delta Eta Gamma Iota Iota Delta Xi Kappa Theta Pi South Xi Iota Omicron Mu Pi South Xi Pi Alumna. Club Contributions sent to the Settlement School Treasurer totaled $12,175.24, a very welcome in-crease of $635.71 over the previous year. In addition, certain clubs sent $197 to the Director for special use. This increased support and confidence is most heartening. In keeping with a friendly tradition, the record follows of those clubs giving $150 or over, with number of consecutive years since 1949 in parentheses: Pittsburgh $1,300.00 Schenectady $175.00 Kansas City (14) ... 1,000.00 Northern New jersey St. Louis (14) . .. 770.00 (3) 150.00 Cleveland East (2) 375.00 Philadelphia-Delco 150.00 North Shore (6) 367.00 Columbus, Ohio (2) . 150.00 Pasadena (6) 309.00 Arlington Heights (4) 150.00 Indianapolis (14) .. 270.00 .................. . Omaha 233.50 Everett (7) 150.00 Westchester Co. (4) . 200.00 South Coast, Calif. ... 150.00 Los Angeles 200.00 While regretting the loss of 6 clubs having started a nice sequence, we welcome an equal number of new clubs to the fold! The above 17 clubs gave 47% of total contributions this year. Many thanks to them as to the many other clubs who gave equally well and even more in pro-portion to their size. All clubs will be interested to learn of a change in Soaring Pigeon Awards next year. Hence-forth these awards for both club contributions and Arrow-craft remittances will be made on a basis of club member-ship for the year. The groupings to be used are: up through 24, 25-49, 50-74, 75-99, 100 and over. To equalize the total number of club and chapter awards, the latter will be increased to the 10 highest in chapter contributions. We believe these to be very good changes for these tokens of recognition and appreciation, even though club winners will be much more difficult to determine. From $3,136.55 received in Chapter Contributions by the Treasurer, part will be used for operating expenses and $1,560.77 will be added to the Settlement School Endowment Fund for a 1963 total of $81,744.18. As THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 31 this year's chapter gifts were $270.21 less than the prior year and involved 5 less 100% provinces, the May 31 fiscal year may again be a factor. Our thanks go to all chapters who donated on time and also to the 2 chapters giving $42.48 to the Director for special purposes. Honorable mention for chapters traditionally is for $100 or more. Chapters thus recognized, with consecutive years, are: Nevada A (2) $175.00 Missouri B (13) $100.00 Texas A. (2) 150.00 Nebraska B (2) 100.00 Texas I' (8) 150.00 Montana A 100.00 Alabama B (4) 100.00 In addition to the annual cash donations from clubs and chapters that are so essential, many Pi Phis make generous contributions to the Settlement School each year. Though individually recorded, such gifts may be designated for club or chapter credit if desired, and they provide personal tax exemptions. Many other gifts of goods, magazines, books, Christmas remembrances and TV or SH stamps were received. All are welcome and provide nice surprises! Magazine Commissions in the amount of $8,351.70 were received and we are very grateful to the Magazine Chair-men who worked so hard to attain this total. Two years ago magazine commissions were approaching equal status with club contributions, but since then they have dropped over $2,900-to our considerable financial concern. Is it too much to ask every Pi Phi to review her own magazine subscriptions in the light of fraternity loyalty? Memorial Fund gifts this year came to $325, of which $55 was from clubs honoring a deceased member. Instead of sending flowers, a contribution to this fund is a meaningful, fraternity way to express love and tribute. Notifications of two bequests to the Settlement School were received this year, with payments to be made following probate. One was a bequest from the will of Ruth Kathryn Shoudy, Washington Beta, in the amount of $500. The other was a legacy of $2,000 from the estate of Anna Marie DeCastello in honor of her mother, Anna Many DeCastello, a charter member of Iowa Sigma. Pi Beta Phi in the lives of both former members must have been very personal, sincere and longlasting and it is an honor for the Settlement School to be remembered in this way. The May L. Keller Award for the best chapter program on the Settlement School was awarded this year to Ruth Sullivan of Alabama Alpha. The committee always finds this a very interesting though diffi-:,alt selection to make, only wishing that every chapter sent its best program of the year for consideration. Improvements made at the Settlement School this year were: acoustical ceiling for the dining room, rewiring of Pollard Cottage, new art tables and renovation of the Emma Harper Turner building, air-conditioners for the Weaving Studio where classwork is a very warm activity, new screen doors at the Red Barn, various indoor and outside painting, a new hedge along Pi Phi lane, and new drainage tiling where needed. Then too, there is always this and that to fix! The changing status of real property owned by and providing so-called "competitive business" income for educational, religious and charitable institutions is well known. It extends across the land. Last year the Arrowcraft portion of the property was assessed for ad valorem taxes for the first time in its history. Thorough review of a 1962 state Supreme Court case involving a comparable situation was so convincing of this trend that to instigate an appeal would have been futile. Even though this tax is not prohibitive it marks a new status for that corner plot of the property. It also serves as a sharp reminder that no presenteducational or related-service endeavor may be released until something to take its place is firmly entrenched. The afterglow of that wonderful Smithsonian Institution Exhibit, the highlight of the Settlement School's 50th anniversary, was evidently bright throughout the fraternity all year. In retrospect it is still quite remarkable that The National Museum of the United States should pay a full month's tribute to Pi Beta Phi for its Arrowcraft and Craft Workshop phases of work at the Settlement School. There should be implications for the future as we reflect upon the stature of that recognition. The committee had another busy and interesting year. The Settlement School Program Guide was completed and sent to all chapters and clubs last fall. As this was planned for ready reference in program planning, we sincerely hope it is used and not just filed away! Secretary Lois Over-street Summers did a fine job with Minutes compiled in both Washington and Gatlinburg; she greatly assisted the chairman all through the year and also wrote numerous thank-you notes for the committee. Eloise Glazner Hensley compiled a fine new slides program (this is done every year), and had much correspondence to schedule this and the convention program among clubs and chapters for the best slides year ever recorded. Sally Bosman Schneiter came through her first year as Treasurer with flying colors, and is eager to receive at any time those nice envelopes containing checks! Sally Wild Gordon assumed her Publicity work with ease the Fall letter to clubs and chapters, Little Pigeon News articles, and distribution of large glossies for display and publicity purposes. The entire committee wishes to assist any club or chapter in every possible way. There is this reminder: when a specific date is involved for information, a slides program or publicity material, please write as early as possible. The fullness of the past year was made immeasurably easier and nicer by the assistance of all Grand Council members, but especially by the thoughtful and prompt guidance given by our adviser, Olivia Smith Moore. We also wish to thank her for another of her "little stock gifts" so quietly given for a third time. It is a very sincere pleasure to welcome Dorothy Cole-man Thorman, Illinois Epsilon, as the new Chairman of the Settlement School Committee. She brings a fine fraternity background to the position as former Iota Alumnae Province President and former Chairman of Manuals. This experience combined with her numerous personal abilities promise outstanding leadership in the important Settlement School years ahead. Close association with the Settlement School is a privilege the retiring chairman wishes might be shared by every Pi Phi. It has brought appreciation of just how much continuous fraternity loyalty and investment can accomplish. It has brought realization of the worth of a past heritage in planning a future course. When Libbie Brook Gaddis accepted the Settlement School for the Founders in 1918, she said, "We are overwhelmed when we think of the honor you have conferred upon us in permitting the Settlement School to stand as a Memorial to your Founders." With a fresh look at the words "to stand as a Memorial to your Founders," it has brought a strong conviction that the Centennial Project proposal for the Settlement School is more than something feasible and realistic, it is the right decision for the fraternity. It is a keeping of faith with the Founders of Pi Beta Phi that the Settlement School shall continue to stand in new ways to serve the educational needs of a changing society. HELEN MOFFETT RUSSELL, Chairman t THE ARROW OF P1 BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL DIRECTOR'S REPORT atlinburg The village of Gatlinburg borders the Great Smoky [ountain National Park, hence is ideally located to accom-Lodate many tourists. Since World War II the facilities ave increased to the extent that over six thousand tourists Lay obtain housing in one of many motels, or in one of le four hotels. Yet the census reports slightly over two sousand population for the village. Highways 441 and 73 rovide the route of scenic beauty as one approaches Gatnburg and remains the predominant attraction to the tea. In the heart of Gatlinburg on the Parkway (Highways 41 and 73), one notices the Pi Beta Phi Arrowcraft Shop, i Beta Phi-University of Tennessee Workshop, Health enter, and Settlement School signs. Entering the school the one leaves the frequently bumper-to-bumper traffic nd notes the Pi Beta Phi buildings. For an armchair tour f the grounds it is logical to stop at the Loom House ihich was completed in June of 1962. raft Workshops The Craft Center with one large wing accommodating pproximately thirty looms serves as weaving studio and lassroom during summer workshop. Adult craft classes wet there during the winter months. Classes in weaving, apestry weaving and rug making, jewelry, stitchery and ottery have proved very popular with students both locally nd from nearby towns including two from North Caroina and two from Georgia. Many have shown interest in uture craft classes. With the Prouty gift at 1962 Convention contributing oward a future ceramic wing, naturally our thoughts turn o the future possibilities. These admittedly are dreams at resent; however, I think we can honestly classify some of hese "possibilities" as "needs." Manpower and money are vasted in shifting from winter school setup to summer vorkshop and vice versa. Moving heavy equipment adds o the risk of breakage. Emphasis might well be directed therwise toward a permanent setup. Handcrafts are not new. Yes, Pi Phi pioneered in reiving weaving in this Appalachian area, yet crafts have ,een made since early history. The Bible refers to the wool and flax weaver "She maketh fine linen, and selleth t." Pottery also served for utilitarian purposes as well as conomic in Biblical times. Now crafts have an indispensable place in culture also. ['he religious motifs the madonna, the cross, crucifix, tar, and three kings are frequently used. At our Pi Phi workshops many beautiful crafts are produced by proessionals as well those who are attempting to acquire .n inner satisfaction with a craft as a sideline. There may )e a therapeutic value this summer a blind girl took )ottery; a soon-to-be retired doctor was apparently searchng for a future way of self-expression. The aesthetic -alue was obviously being sought by several. Art super-'isors came for refresher courses, students to complete Eegrees. Each year I am more proud of the final exhibit 'feces. Much credit for this attainment is given our Work-hop Director, Marian Heard, who for eighteen years has lemanded that there be a high standard of workmanship. Perhaps you are a Pi Phi, hoping to come to Workshop onetime (many express that wish), and wondering a bit bout the advantages of handcrafts. They may be summed ip briefly as follows: Crafts develop skill provide a creative outlet may be a form of recreation increase sensitiveness to surroundings and give dignity to common things frequently bring out unsuspected abilities furnish aesthetic satisfaction and are pathways to wonder and beauty that form a link between nature and art explain and help rationalize the machine bring the handicapped into better adjustments. The economic, aesthetic, educational and therapeutic values overlap into almost any craft program. Not many folks get into trouble while working. It's the leisure time or free time which must be watched. Handcrafts taken up as recreation may be the answer. According to mountaineer terminology I'm "right proud" of our summer Craft Workshop. It is amazing and inspiring to see so many students with such varied interests work for similar goals. In February or March workshop information is sent to each Alumnae Club and Active Chapter using Central Office addressograph listing. If your Club or Chapter does not receive a brochure and letter, kindly inform my office. Our sincere wish is that many more Pi Phis could participate in this nationally, and internationally-known project. Scholarships may be made available through Clubs and other sources. Through this endeavor there are end-less opportunities for Pi Phi to broaden the horizons at Settlement School. Arrowcraft Shop Our Arrowcraft Shop sells many different crafts from the Southern Highlands. Weaving still remains the specialty of the shop. With the many Club sales (small ones count, too !), there is great evidence of the loyalty of many Pi Phi members who not only give hours but years in this voluntary work. Settlement School staff is aware of this, and deep appreciation is extended to every Pi Phi who participates. In the Settlement School Chairman's report the results of sales will be given. Arrowcraft averages sixty weavers who bring their products to the shop for sale throughout the year. This represents a large sum which has an economic influence some weaving to supplement their husband's income, others making it their livelihood. Maria Lou Tate, Florida Beta, came as manager of Arrow-craft in November, and is proving most capable. June 10 (the first day of summer workshop) Corrine Purdom began her duties as weaving designer for Arrowcraft. This job is a difficult one to fill, yet with Corrine's Master's Degree in Weaving, gradually new items should appear. Since the price list is effective for one year, radical changes cannot be made mid-year. Perhaps one of the greatest honors that has ever come to Arrowcraft and our Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennessee Workshop was the invitation to display weaving in the Textile Division of the Smithsonian Institute for one month in 1962. Many Pi Phis who attended the Convention in Washington had the privilege of seeing this large exhibit in the Rotunda. The request for some of the weaving to be in a permanent collection at the Smithsonian was a compliment, indeed. Pi Phi standards are high and consequently rewarding. Hotel Arrowcraft Shop Elizabeth Rue, Iowa Gamma, continues as manager of the Mountain View Hotel Shop. Being semi-retired, she has developed many outside interests in the community and church. Health Center Our Jennie Nicol Health Center perhaps witnessed the greatest change Nurse Marjorie Chalmers having retired after twenty-seven years at Settlement School. In November Brenda Allison, R.N., from the University of Tennessee, accepted the challenge as replacement for much seniority. Brenda has done that very capably the key to success perhaps being a youthful viewpoint. Funds for a much-needed County Hospital are ap THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 33 proved. Approximately fifty beds will be a radical change from the six-bed clinic of a local physician in Gatlinburg. The hospital will be near the County seat approximately twelve miles from Gatlinburg. Gatlinburg School 1963 doubtless will be remembered as a year of many changes. Five miles east a new high school is scheduled for occupancy in late August. In 1937 the first four-year class graduated from Pi Beta Phi High School (the only Gatlinburg School). The high school annual The .Mountaineer with pictures of Pi Beta Phi High School appropriately had this caption: "For much longer than any of us can remember, these bells have regulated the days, where countless students have worked and worried and laughed and played and searched for knowledge." Over six hundred graduates have passed through the Pi Beta Phi Halls of Ivy. With the consolidation of nearby Pitman Center the new school will be known as Gatlinburg-Pitman High School. Pi Beta Phi will keep its name at the elementary school (grades 1-8) in Gatlinburg, and the Settlement School which includes thirteen buildings and over seventy acres of land. Emily Burchfiel Kile, a University of Tennessee graduate, taught Art and Crafts for Pi Phi during 1962-1963. Mary Ruth Smith, having acquired her Master's degree at the University of Tennessee is scheduled to teach Art and Crafts in 1963-1964. At this writing there is no replacement for Glenn Terry who developed an excellent music program last year. It was decided to discontinue the wood-working classes with the removal of the high school. The Dormitory Fifteen to twenty boys and girls were "living in" throughout the year. A few were eventually dropouts from school, hence from the dormitory. One of the cases was an eighth grade boy who was seventeen years old. Deplorable, indeed! Because he is a future citizen who will be rearing a family someday and voting in our democratic government. . . . There was a goodly number of honors to balance the score. These various honors captain of foot-ball, members of Student Council, parts in class plays, class officers perhaps are the only tangible evidence of accomplishments. However, those of us who work with the children literally "see" growth not only physically, but in character and personality. At graduation it was truly thrilling for a three-year dormitory boy to receive the award for the best all-round boy as chosen by the faculty; also for a freshman dormitory boy to receive the award (also as chosen by the faculty) for the most improvement. A four-year dormitory girl received the award for showing the best sportsmanship in basketball. Living in the dormitory is broadening experience for the students. It's character building to "keep hours" and assume responsibilities in addition to their school work. Our slogan is to be a good student first, then find time for other activities. (Needless to say, all do not attain their goal.) Ruth Spelman, a Golden Arrow Pi Phi from Illinois Epsilon, serves as housemother for the girls. The Red Barn The Red Barn continues to be popular with religious, philanthropic, and educational groups for retreats and workshops. The Owls' Nest and Little Pigeon Loft prove to be an attraction. Personnel All personnel is the same except for new staff rnembers mentioned previously. With the thirteen buildings and over seventy acres there is an endless amount of maintenance. Orlie Watson for over thirty-seven years with Settlement School is always ready for emergencies (and somehow, they have a way of coming at night). Neal, Zanley, and Richard Watson "don't even have time for fishing." It is a rare day that something doesn't have to be "fixed." The winter weather was most unusual, the coldest ever, with ten days of school missed (the time had to be made up before the end of the semester). In cold weather there is always much "busyness" preventing trouble. Gateway Theatre On this tour of the school grounds during the summer one notes a sign at the school building, saying "Gateway Theatre." John Richards has directed a young group of theatrical students from the American Academy of Drama in New York for seventeen summers. His repertoire of four or five plays is given in the school auditorium. Little Pigeon Alumni Club This Alumnae Club is fortunate to have approximately fourteen Pi Phis in the vicinity, hence has developed an increasing interest and loyalty to Settlement School. Evidence of this was the Evelyn Bishop Lounge in the Loom House which was dedicated in July 1962. This room was furnished with the Memorial Fund to which many local citizens as well as Pi Phis everywhere honored the first head resident of Settlement School. Lest We Forget Our Memorial to our Pi Beta Phi Founders is some-thing of which every Pi Beta Phi should be proud. By keeping alive the best of the past, it helps us tc build the future. Let us light TOMORROW with TODAY ! Respectfully submitted, MARION W. MUELLER, Director Accountants' Report Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Committee, Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, Gatlinburg, Tennessee. We have examined the balance sheet of Pi Beta Ph Settlement School as of May 31, 1963, and the relatec statements of income and expenses and fund balances fol the year then ended. Our examination was made in ac cordance with generally accepted auditing standards and except that we did not observe the procedures employec in ascertaining inventory quantities or make tests of the valuation thereof, it included such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures as we consid ered necessary in the circumstances. As the scope of our examination did not include ob servance of the inventory-taking or tests of the inventor] quantities or valuation thereof, and as we were unable t( satisfy ourselves by other means as to the amount at -whict the inventory is stated, we are not in a position to ex press an opinion upon the financial statements. However otherwise than as affected by the foregoing exception, i is our opinion that the statements have been prepared 1'1 accordance with generally accepted accounting principle applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding year.

We promptly put them all to work, and they responded beautifully. On the recommendation of our architect, Mr. James M. Battersby, AIA, of Knoxville, Illinois, we had (1) four round steel columns put in the northwest corner of the basement to shore up the beams and joists; (2) the floors on the first floor levelled and refinished; and (3) the east exterior wall brushed and repainted where the paint was peeling. Mrs. Hines, our hostess at Holt House, reports the refinished floors look lovely. We had sad news in the fact that we lost four trees to the dutch elm disease last summer. They have been removed, but will also have to be replaced. The kitchen cabinets have new hardware, which is the first since the original restoration. A Holt House sign has been placed on Broadway, the main street in Monmouth, thanks to the efforts of Cleone Barnes Rawson, the Monmouth member of our committee. We have had complaints about the lack of such a sign for many years, and are grateful for her work in securing per-mission to have one. At the fall meeting of the Holt House committee we hired Mrs. Ada Willer-Peterson, AID, of Chicago to help with the long range planning and redecorating of Holt House. We hope to repaper the dining room and Pine room this summer, and put up new curtains in both rooms. The decorator has sent sample boxes to the committee, from which they are to make their selection. Next year we hope to do the parlor and hall. Our aim is to have Holt House in A-1 condition by the Centennial in 1967. From May 1, 1962 to April 30, 1963 Holt House was used 128 times, 17 of them by Pi Phis. We have purposely kept the rentals low so more clubs and individuals would feel they could use it. In this way we feel it is helping to serve the purpose to which our Founders aspired. Many clubs use it as a regular meeting place, and we have had several wedding receptions this year. Forty-seven chapters and clubs have used the slides for programs this year, This is a record! If you haven't seen them, try to schedule them this fall. They are most interesting and informative, and a script accompanies them. Send your requests in early to Miss Margaret Dick, 288 Southmoreland, Decatur, Illinois. Pi Province North sent us 5 green stamp books, and with them plus some others we had, we were able to purchase a copper kitchen clock, and a large coffee maker. The latter delighted all the clubs, because they formerly had to furnish their own. Marion Keck Simmons sent four books which are quite an addition to our library. A 100% record of contributions last year from the active chapters was a first. Only 8 alumni clubs refrained from donating. We hope we will have 100% from both this year. Your contributions are necessary to keep Holt House in tip top shape. For those of you who have never visited Holt House, I hope someday you may. It is lovely, and the ideals it symbolizes are worth everything we can do to keep them going.

SHIRLEY JONES MANN Accountants' Report Holt House Committee, Pi Beta Phi, Galesburg, Illinois. We have examined the accompanying statement of fund balance of the Holt House Treasurer Pi Beta Phi, resulting from recorded cash transactions, for the year ended May 31, 1963. Our examination was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records, and such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. In our opinion, the accompanying statement presents fairly the fund balance of the Holt House Treasurer Pi Beta Phi at May 31, 1963, resulting from recorded cash transactions, and the receipts collected and expenses disbursed during the year then ended, on a basis consistent with that of the preceding year.

        30 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Eon the wisdom of closing our dormitory doors completely. Surely the composite heart of Pi Beta Phi is large enough to make i-oom for a few most needy young people each year, whether or not we call it a standing program. Ruth Spelman completed her 5th year as capable, genial housemother for the girls at Stuart Dormitory and, most happily, will continue next year. Lela Adams will continue her dual work as matron of the boys' dormitory and Staff House cook. Marion Mueller, of course, will again fill her "challenging" role as program director most capably and attentively as she similarly fills each of her numerous and varied responsibilities. Brendel Fund income was used to provide music lessons for certain dorm students. The Alspaugh Scholarship ($200) was awarded to Ronnie Moore for advanced study in art. Unfortunately, three dormitory boys added their statistics to the national drop-out problem, due to factors beyond our control. Viewing the year as a whole, it was another worthwhile and productive year to add to those that have preceded it. The Arrowcraft Shop The new look at the Arrowcraft Shop this year concerned people! On November 15, Maria Hutchins Tate, Florida Beta, arrived to begin her duties as Manager. She has been warmly welcomed by both shop and resident staffs, and we hope she will be with us a long time. Wino-gene Redding who helped inaugurate the Arrowcraft project in 1926 retired in mid-May. She had 4 different employment periods as Weaving Designer, and her many years of interest and service at Arrowcraft are very appreciated. Mrs. Corinne Purdom arrived on June 10 to start her responsibilities as Weaving Designer, having a fine back-ground for this unique position which involves creative designing for quantity production. It is always nice to have continuing personnel: Elizabeth Rue, Iowa Gamma, as cordial Manager of the Mountain View Hotel Shop, Eunice Cole as Bookkeeper, Nella Hill as Assistant to Mrs. Purdom, Faye Cook as Head of Shipping assisted by Gene Hembree, and Shirley Roberts and June Cook as salesgirls. We have a very fine, competent and cooperative staff of 8 regular employees at the Arrowcraft Shop. Shelves and storage places are bulging with beautiful handweaving and other interesting crafts, ready and waiting for another busy fall shipping season. Alumnx. club orders are, and always have been, the mainstay of Arrowcraft. Again we wish to say "thank you" to every Pi Phi who individually or collectively continues to provide needed work for 60 to 70 weavers annually, as well as to provide sizable outlets for other craftsmen. There was a fine increase in club sales both in weaving and other crafts and this is encouraging. Stress should continue to be on weaving for this is the Arrowcraft specialty. While many smaller clubs participate magnificently in the Arrowcraft project, it has long been a "friendly competition" tradition to name those clubs remitting over $1000 for Arrowcraft products during the past years, as follows: Champaign-Urbana $3,313.28 San Antonio $1,445.36 Akron 2,479.77 Beaumont 1,416.09 Pittsburgh 2,237.74 Warren-Youngstown 1,361.98 North Shore 2,209.97 Albuquerque 1,353.68 Wichita 2,085.13 Indianapolis 1,333.57 Philadelphia-Main Ardmore 1,305.73 Line 1,823.47 Northern New Jersey Berkeley 1,768.38 1,227.90 Bloomfield Hills 1,742.16 Gary 1,127.51 Arlington Heights 1,726.89 Chattanooga 1,116.15 South Bend 1,678.54 Milwaukee 1,099.53 Oklahoma City 1,656.06 Fayetteville 1,053.27 Stillwater 1,635.79 Cleveland East 1,042.94 Columbus, Ohio . 1,620.03 South Hills 1,040.12 Denver 1,546.11 Baltimore 1,015.00 Schenectady 1,462.60 Harrisburg-Carlyle 1,006.68 Periodically it seems necessary to remind clubs and chapters to please pay their Arrowcraft bills promptly. (Our auditors scolded the committee rather severely aboutthat this year so it is our role to be the spokesman in this matter.) It helps most when bills are paid by invoice as soon as a shipment is received and checked. Next best is payment within 60 days from date of shipment. This can be stretched to 90 days if necessary. The rub comes when accounts are not paid in full by the end of the fiscal year (May 31), and worse, if carried for a year or more. It might clarify Arrowcraft's need for prompt payment to state that while clubs and chapters may charge, Arrow-craft may not! Everything must be paid for before it is shipped. We are all in this together and when there is real need for an extension of time, a written explanation will help. With understanding and cooperation, the present plan can be continued and we all can look forward to an even better year for Arrowcraft in 1963-64. Readers might like to know in advance of the 1964 Convention that it is our present understanding we may not have an Arrowcraft sale at Victoria next summer. So the plan is to have an extensive Arrowcraft Exhibit instead. That will be one convention where a notebook will be more valuable than a pocketbook! Other Information Of The Year There were fewer 100% Provinces in Contributions to the Settlement School this year compared to last 1 less among clubs and 5 less among chapters. We believe the May 31 end of fiscal year at the Settlement School to be a factor in this drop, and urge annual reminders of this dateline. 100% provinces this year were: Clubs Chapters Both Alpha Alpha Alpha Delta Beta Delta Eta Gamma Iota Iota Delta Xi Kappa Theta Pi South Xi Iota Omicron Mu Pi South Xi Pi Alumna. Club Contributions sent to the Settlement School Treasurer totaled $12,175.24, a very welcome in-crease of $635.71 over the previous year. In addition, certain clubs sent $197 to the Director for special use. This increased support and confidence is most heartening. In keeping with a friendly tradition, the record follows of those clubs giving $150 or over, with number of consecutive years since 1949 in parentheses: Pittsburgh $1,300.00 Schenectady $175.00 Kansas City (14) ... 1,000.00 Northern New jersey St. Louis (14) . .. 770.00 (3) 150.00 Cleveland East (2) 375.00 Philadelphia-Delco 150.00 North Shore (6) 367.00 Columbus, Ohio (2) . 150.00 Pasadena (6) 309.00 Arlington Heights (4) 150.00 Indianapolis (14) .. 270.00 .................. . Omaha 233.50 Everett (7) 150.00 Westchester Co. (4) . 200.00 South Coast, Calif. ... 150.00 Los Angeles 200.00 While regretting the loss of 6 clubs having started a nice sequence, we welcome an equal number of new clubs to the fold! The above 17 clubs gave 47% of total contributions this year. Many thanks to them as to the many other clubs who gave equally well and even more in pro-portion to their size. All clubs will be interested to learn of a change in Soaring Pigeon Awards next year. Hence-forth these awards for both club contributions and Arrow-craft remittances will be made on a basis of club member-ship for the year. The groupings to be used are: up through 24, 25-49, 50-74, 75-99, 100 and over. To equalize the total number of club and chapter awards, the latter will be increased to the 10 highest in chapter contributions. We believe these to be very good changes for these tokens of recognition and appreciation, even though club winners will be much more difficult to determine. From $3,136.55 received in Chapter Contributions by the Treasurer, part will be used for operating expenses and $1,560.77 will be added to the Settlement School Endowment Fund for a 1963 total of $81,744.18. As THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 31 this year's chapter gifts were $270.21 less than the prior year and involved 5 less 100% provinces, the May 31 fiscal year may again be a factor. Our thanks go to all chapters who donated on time and also to the 2 chapters giving $42.48 to the Director for special purposes. Honorable mention for chapters traditionally is for $100 or more. Chapters thus recognized, with consecutive years, are: Nevada A (2) $175.00 Missouri B (13) $100.00 Texas A. (2) 150.00 Nebraska B (2) 100.00 Texas I' (8) 150.00 Montana A 100.00 Alabama B (4) 100.00 In addition to the annual cash donations from clubs and chapters that are so essential, many Pi Phis make generous contributions to the Settlement School each year. Though individually recorded, such gifts may be designated for club or chapter credit if desired, and they provide personal tax exemptions. Many other gifts of goods, magazines, books, Christmas remembrances and TV or SH stamps were received. All are welcome and provide nice surprises! Magazine Commissions in the amount of $8,351.70 were received and we are very grateful to the Magazine Chair-men who worked so hard to attain this total. Two years ago magazine commissions were approaching equal status with club contributions, but since then they have dropped over $2,900-to our considerable financial concern. Is it too much to ask every Pi Phi to review her own magazine subscriptions in the light of fraternity loyalty? Memorial Fund gifts this year came to $325, of which $55 was from clubs honoring a deceased member. Instead of sending flowers, a contribution to this fund is a meaningful, fraternity way to express love and tribute. Notifications of two bequests to the Settlement School were received this year, with payments to be made following probate. One was a bequest from the will of Ruth Kathryn Shoudy, Washington Beta, in the amount of $500. The other was a legacy of $2,000 from the estate of Anna Marie DeCastello in honor of her mother, Anna Many DeCastello, a charter member of Iowa Sigma. Pi Beta Phi in the lives of both former members must have been very personal, sincere and longlasting and it is an honor for the Settlement School to be remembered in this way. The May L. Keller Award for the best chapter program on the Settlement School was awarded this year to Ruth Sullivan of Alabama Alpha. The committee always finds this a very interesting though diffi-:,alt selection to make, only wishing that every chapter sent its best program of the year for consideration. Improvements made at the Settlement School this year were: acoustical ceiling for the dining room, rewiring of Pollard Cottage, new art tables and renovation of the Emma Harper Turner building, air-conditioners for the Weaving Studio where classwork is a very warm activity, new screen doors at the Red Barn, various indoor and outside painting, a new hedge along Pi Phi lane, and new drainage tiling where needed. Then too, there is always this and that to fix! The changing status of real property owned by and providing so-called "competitive business" income for educational, religious and charitable institutions is well known. It extends across the land. Last year the Arrowcraft portion of the property was assessed for ad valorem taxes for the first time in its history. Thorough review of a 1962 state Supreme Court case involving a comparable situation was so convincing of this trend that to instigate an appeal would have been futile. Even though this tax is not prohibitive it marks a new status for that corner plot of the property. It also serves as a sharp reminder that no presenteducational or related-service endeavor may be released until something to take its place is firmly entrenched. The afterglow of that wonderful Smithsonian Institution Exhibit, the highlight of the Settlement School's 50th anniversary, was evidently bright throughout the fraternity all year. In retrospect it is still quite remarkable that The National Museum of the United States should pay a full month's tribute to Pi Beta Phi for its Arrowcraft and Craft Workshop phases of work at the Settlement School. There should be implications for the future as we reflect upon the stature of that recognition. The committee had another busy and interesting year. The Settlement School Program Guide was completed and sent to all chapters and clubs last fall. As this was planned for ready reference in program planning, we sincerely hope it is used and not just filed away! Secretary Lois Over-street Summers did a fine job with Minutes compiled in both Washington and Gatlinburg; she greatly assisted the chairman all through the year and also wrote numerous thank-you notes for the committee. Eloise Glazner Hensley compiled a fine new slides program (this is done every year), and had much correspondence to schedule this and the convention program among clubs and chapters for the best slides year ever recorded. Sally Bosman Schneiter came through her first year as Treasurer with flying colors, and is eager to receive at any time those nice envelopes containing checks! Sally Wild Gordon assumed her Publicity work with ease the Fall letter to clubs and chapters, Little Pigeon News articles, and distribution of large glossies for display and publicity purposes. The entire committee wishes to assist any club or chapter in every possible way. There is this reminder: when a specific date is involved for information, a slides program or publicity material, please write as early as possible. The fullness of the past year was made immeasurably easier and nicer by the assistance of all Grand Council members, but especially by the thoughtful and prompt guidance given by our adviser, Olivia Smith Moore. We also wish to thank her for another of her "little stock gifts" so quietly given for a third time. It is a very sincere pleasure to welcome Dorothy Cole-man Thorman, Illinois Epsilon, as the new Chairman of the Settlement School Committee. She brings a fine fraternity background to the position as former Iota Alumnae Province President and former Chairman of Manuals. This experience combined with her numerous personal abilities promise outstanding leadership in the important Settlement School years ahead. Close association with the Settlement School is a privilege the retiring chairman wishes might be shared by every Pi Phi. It has brought appreciation of just how much continuous fraternity loyalty and investment can accomplish. It has brought realization of the worth of a past heritage in planning a future course. When Libbie Brook Gaddis accepted the Settlement School for the Founders in 1918, she said, "We are overwhelmed when we think of the honor you have conferred upon us in permitting the Settlement School to stand as a Memorial to your Founders." With a fresh look at the words "to stand as a Memorial to your Founders," it has brought a strong conviction that the Centennial Project proposal for the Settlement School is more than something feasible and realistic, it is the right decision for the fraternity. It is a keeping of faith with the Founders of Pi Beta Phi that the Settlement School shall continue to stand in new ways to serve the educational needs of a changing society. HELEN MOFFETT RUSSELL, Chairman t THE ARROW OF P1 BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL DIRECTOR'S REPORT atlinburg The village of Gatlinburg borders the Great Smoky [ountain National Park, hence is ideally located to accom-Lodate many tourists. Since World War II the facilities ave increased to the extent that over six thousand tourists Lay obtain housing in one of many motels, or in one of le four hotels. Yet the census reports slightly over two sousand population for the village. Highways 441 and 73 rovide the route of scenic beauty as one approaches Gatnburg and remains the predominant attraction to the tea. In the heart of Gatlinburg on the Parkway (Highways 41 and 73), one notices the Pi Beta Phi Arrowcraft Shop, i Beta Phi-University of Tennessee Workshop, Health enter, and Settlement School signs. Entering the school the one leaves the frequently bumper-to-bumper traffic nd notes the Pi Beta Phi buildings. For an armchair tour f the grounds it is logical to stop at the Loom House ihich was completed in June of 1962. raft Workshops The Craft Center with one large wing accommodating pproximately thirty looms serves as weaving studio and lassroom during summer workshop. Adult craft classes wet there during the winter months. Classes in weaving, apestry weaving and rug making, jewelry, stitchery and ottery have proved very popular with students both locally nd from nearby towns including two from North Caroina and two from Georgia. Many have shown interest in uture craft classes. With the Prouty gift at 1962 Convention contributing oward a future ceramic wing, naturally our thoughts turn o the future possibilities. These admittedly are dreams at resent; however, I think we can honestly classify some of hese "possibilities" as "needs." Manpower and money are vasted in shifting from winter school setup to summer vorkshop and vice versa. Moving heavy equipment adds o the risk of breakage. Emphasis might well be directed therwise toward a permanent setup. Handcrafts are not new. Yes, Pi Phi pioneered in reiving weaving in this Appalachian area, yet crafts have ,een made since early history. The Bible refers to the wool and flax weaver "She maketh fine linen, and selleth t." Pottery also served for utilitarian purposes as well as conomic in Biblical times. Now crafts have an indispensable place in culture also. ['he religious motifs the madonna, the cross, crucifix, tar, and three kings are frequently used. At our Pi Phi workshops many beautiful crafts are produced by proessionals as well those who are attempting to acquire .n inner satisfaction with a craft as a sideline. There may )e a therapeutic value this summer a blind girl took )ottery; a soon-to-be retired doctor was apparently searchng for a future way of self-expression. The aesthetic -alue was obviously being sought by several. Art super-'isors came for refresher courses, students to complete Eegrees. Each year I am more proud of the final exhibit 'feces. Much credit for this attainment is given our Work-hop Director, Marian Heard, who for eighteen years has lemanded that there be a high standard of workmanship. Perhaps you are a Pi Phi, hoping to come to Workshop onetime (many express that wish), and wondering a bit bout the advantages of handcrafts. They may be summed ip briefly as follows: Crafts develop skill provide a creative outlet may be a form of recreation increase sensitiveness to surroundings and give dignity to common things frequently bring out unsuspected abilities furnish aesthetic satisfaction and are pathways to wonder and beauty that form a link between nature and art explain and help rationalize the machine bring the handicapped into better adjustments. The economic, aesthetic, educational and therapeutic values overlap into almost any craft program. Not many folks get into trouble while working. It's the leisure time or free time which must be watched. Handcrafts taken up as recreation may be the answer. According to mountaineer terminology I'm "right proud" of our summer Craft Workshop. It is amazing and inspiring to see so many students with such varied interests work for similar goals. In February or March workshop information is sent to each Alumnae Club and Active Chapter using Central Office addressograph listing. If your Club or Chapter does not receive a brochure and letter, kindly inform my office. Our sincere wish is that many more Pi Phis could participate in this nationally, and internationally-known project. Scholarships may be made available through Clubs and other sources. Through this endeavor there are end-less opportunities for Pi Phi to broaden the horizons at Settlement School. Arrowcraft Shop Our Arrowcraft Shop sells many different crafts from the Southern Highlands. Weaving still remains the specialty of the shop. With the many Club sales (small ones count, too !), there is great evidence of the loyalty of many Pi Phi members who not only give hours but years in this voluntary work. Settlement School staff is aware of this, and deep appreciation is extended to every Pi Phi who participates. In the Settlement School Chairman's report the results of sales will be given. Arrowcraft averages sixty weavers who bring their products to the shop for sale throughout the year. This represents a large sum which has an economic influence some weaving to supplement their husband's income, others making it their livelihood. Maria Lou Tate, Florida Beta, came as manager of Arrow-craft in November, and is proving most capable. June 10 (the first day of summer workshop) Corrine Purdom began her duties as weaving designer for Arrowcraft. This job is a difficult one to fill, yet with Corrine's Master's Degree in Weaving, gradually new items should appear. Since the price list is effective for one year, radical changes cannot be made mid-year. Perhaps one of the greatest honors that has ever come to Arrowcraft and our Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennessee Workshop was the invitation to display weaving in the Textile Division of the Smithsonian Institute for one month in 1962. Many Pi Phis who attended the Convention in Washington had the privilege of seeing this large exhibit in the Rotunda. The request for some of the weaving to be in a permanent collection at the Smithsonian was a compliment, indeed. Pi Phi standards are high and consequently rewarding. Hotel Arrowcraft Shop Elizabeth Rue, Iowa Gamma, continues as manager of the Mountain View Hotel Shop. Being semi-retired, she has developed many outside interests in the community and church. Health Center Our Jennie Nicol Health Center perhaps witnessed the greatest change Nurse Marjorie Chalmers having retired after twenty-seven years at Settlement School. In November Brenda Allison, R.N., from the University of Tennessee, accepted the challenge as replacement for much seniority. Brenda has done that very capably the key to success perhaps being a youthful viewpoint. Funds for a much-needed County Hospital are ap THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 33 proved. Approximately fifty beds will be a radical change from the six-bed clinic of a local physician in Gatlinburg. The hospital will be near the County seat approximately twelve miles from Gatlinburg. Gatlinburg School 1963 doubtless will be remembered as a year of many changes. Five miles east a new high school is scheduled for occupancy in late August. In 1937 the first four-year class graduated from Pi Beta Phi High School (the only Gatlinburg School). The high school annual The .Mountaineer with pictures of Pi Beta Phi High School appropriately had this caption: "For much longer than any of us can remember, these bells have regulated the days, where countless students have worked and worried and laughed and played and searched for knowledge." Over six hundred graduates have passed through the Pi Beta Phi Halls of Ivy. With the consolidation of nearby Pitman Center the new school will be known as Gatlinburg-Pitman High School. Pi Beta Phi will keep its name at the elementary school (grades 1-8) in Gatlinburg, and the Settlement School which includes thirteen buildings and over seventy acres of land. Emily Burchfiel Kile, a University of Tennessee graduate, taught Art and Crafts for Pi Phi during 1962-1963. Mary Ruth Smith, having acquired her Master's degree at the University of Tennessee is scheduled to teach Art and Crafts in 1963-1964. At this writing there is no replacement for Glenn Terry who developed an excellent music program last year. It was decided to discontinue the wood-working classes with the removal of the high school. The Dormitory Fifteen to twenty boys and girls were "living in" throughout the year. A few were eventually dropouts from school, hence from the dormitory. One of the cases was an eighth grade boy who was seventeen years old. Deplorable, indeed! Because he is a future citizen who will be rearing a family someday and voting in our democratic government. . . . There was a goodly number of honors to balance the score. These various honors captain of foot-ball, members of Student Council, parts in class plays, class officers perhaps are the only tangible evidence of accomplishments. However, those of us who work with the children literally "see" growth not only physically, but in character and personality. At graduation it was truly thrilling for a three-year dormitory boy to receive the award for the best all-round boy as chosen by the faculty; also for a freshman dormitory boy to receive the award (also as chosen by the faculty) for the most improvement. A four-year dormitory girl received the award for showing the best sportsmanship in basketball. Living in the dormitory is broadening experience for the students. It's character building to "keep hours" and assume responsibilities in addition to their school work. Our slogan is to be a good student first, then find time for other activities. (Needless to say, all do not attain their goal.) Ruth Spelman, a Golden Arrow Pi Phi from Illinois Epsilon, serves as housemother for the girls. The Red Barn The Red Barn continues to be popular with religious, philanthropic, and educational groups for retreats and workshops. The Owls' Nest and Little Pigeon Loft prove to be an attraction. Personnel All personnel is the same except for new staff rnembers mentioned previously. With the thirteen buildings and over seventy acres there is an endless amount of maintenance. Orlie Watson for over thirty-seven years with Settlement School is always ready for emergencies (and somehow, they have a way of coming at night). Neal, Zanley, and Richard Watson "don't even have time for fishing." It is a rare day that something doesn't have to be "fixed." The winter weather was most unusual, the coldest ever, with ten days of school missed (the time had to be made up before the end of the semester). In cold weather there is always much "busyness" preventing trouble. Gateway Theatre On this tour of the school grounds during the summer one notes a sign at the school building, saying "Gateway Theatre." John Richards has directed a young group of theatrical students from the American Academy of Drama in New York for seventeen summers. His repertoire of four or five plays is given in the school auditorium. Little Pigeon Alumni Club This Alumnae Club is fortunate to have approximately fourteen Pi Phis in the vicinity, hence has developed an increasing interest and loyalty to Settlement School. Evidence of this was the Evelyn Bishop Lounge in the Loom House which was dedicated in July 1962. This room was furnished with the Memorial Fund to which many local citizens as well as Pi Phis everywhere honored the first head resident of Settlement School. Lest We Forget Our Memorial to our Pi Beta Phi Founders is some-thing of which every Pi Beta Phi should be proud. By keeping alive the best of the past, it helps us tc build the future.

We promptly put them all to work, and they responded beautifully. On the recommendation of our architect, Mr. James M. Battersby, AIA, of Knoxville, Illinois, we had (1) four round steel columns put in the northwest corner of the basement to shore up the beams and joists; (2) the floors on the first floor levelled and refinished; and (3) the east exterior wall brushed and repainted where the paint was peeling. Mrs. Hines, our hostess at Holt House, reports the refinished floors look lovely. We had sad news in the fact that we lost four trees to the dutch elm disease last summer. They have been removed, but will also have to be replaced. The kitchen cabinets have new hardware, which is the first since the original restoration. A Holt House sign has been placed on Broadway, the main street in Monmouth, thanks to the efforts of Cleone Barnes Rawson, the Monmouth member of our committee. We have had complaints about the lack of such a sign for many years, and are grateful for her work in securing per-mission to have one. At the fall meeting of the Holt House committee we hired Mrs. Ada Willer-Peterson, AID, of Chicago to help with the long range planning and redecorating of Holt House. We hope to repaper the dining room and Pine room this summer, and put up new curtains in both rooms. The decorator has sent sample boxes to the committee, from which they are to make their selection. Next year we hope to do the parlor and hall. Our aim is to have Holt House in A-1 condition by the Centennial in 1967. From May 1, 1962 to April 30, 1963 Holt House was used 128 times, 17 of them by Pi Phis. We have purposely kept the rentals low so more clubs and individuals would feel they could use it. In this way we feel it is helping to serve the purpose to which our Founders aspired. Many clubs use it as a regular meeting place, and we have had several wedding receptions this year. Forty-seven chapters and clubs have used the slides for programs this year, This is a record! If you haven't seen them, try to schedule them this fall. They are most interesting and informative, and a script accompanies them. Send your requests in early to Miss Margaret Dick, 288 Southmoreland, Decatur, Illinois. Pi Province North sent us 5 green stamp books, and with them plus some others we had, we were able to purchase a copper kitchen clock, and a large coffee maker. The latter delighted all the clubs, because they formerly had to furnish their own. Marion Keck Simmons sent four books which are quite an addition to our library. A 100% record of contributions last year from the active chapters was a first. Only 8 alumni clubs refrained from donating. We hope we will have 100% from both this year. Your contributions are necessary to keep Holt House in tip top shape. For those of you who have never visited Holt House, I hope someday you may. It is lovely, and the ideals it symbolizes are worth everything we can do to keep them going.

SHIRLEY JONES MANN Accountants' Report Holt House Committee, Pi Beta Phi, Galesburg, Illinois. We have examined the accompanying statement of fund balance of the Holt House Treasurer Pi Beta Phi, resulting from recorded cash transactions, for the year ended May 31, 1963. Our examination was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records, and such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. In our opinion, the accompanying statement presents fairly the fund balance of the Holt House Treasurer Pi Beta Phi at May 31, 1963, resulting from recorded cash transactions, and the receipts collected and expenses disbursed during the year then ended, on a basis consistent with that of the preceding year.

        t THE ARROW OF P1 BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL DIRECTOR'S REPORT atlinburg The village of Gatlinburg borders the Great Smoky [ountain National Park, hence is ideally located to accom-Lodate many tourists. Since World War II the facilities ave increased to the extent that over six thousand tourists Lay obtain housing in one of many motels, or in one of le four hotels. Yet the census reports slightly over two sousand population for the village. Highways 441 and 73 rovide the route of scenic beauty as one approaches Gatnburg and remains the predominant attraction to the tea. In the heart of Gatlinburg on the Parkway (Highways 41 and 73), one notices the Pi Beta Phi Arrowcraft Shop, i Beta Phi-University of Tennessee Workshop, Health enter, and Settlement School signs. Entering the school the one leaves the frequently bumper-to-bumper traffic nd notes the Pi Beta Phi buildings. For an armchair tour f the grounds it is logical to stop at the Loom House ihich was completed in June of 1962. raft Workshops The Craft Center with one large wing accommodating pproximately thirty looms serves as weaving studio and lassroom during summer workshop. Adult craft classes wet there during the winter months. Classes in weaving, apestry weaving and rug making, jewelry, stitchery and ottery have proved very popular with students both locally nd from nearby towns including two from North Caroina and two from Georgia. Many have shown interest in uture craft classes. With the Prouty gift at 1962 Convention contributing oward a future ceramic wing, naturally our thoughts turn o the future possibilities. These admittedly are dreams at resent; however, I think we can honestly classify some of hese "possibilities" as "needs." Manpower and money are vasted in shifting from winter school setup to summer vorkshop and vice versa. Moving heavy equipment adds o the risk of breakage. Emphasis might well be directed therwise toward a permanent setup. Handcrafts are not new. Yes, Pi Phi pioneered in reiving weaving in this Appalachian area, yet crafts have ,een made since early history. The Bible refers to the wool and flax weaver "She maketh fine linen, and selleth t." Pottery also served for utilitarian purposes as well as conomic in Biblical times. Now crafts have an indispensable place in culture also. ['he religious motifs the madonna, the cross, crucifix, tar, and three kings are frequently used. At our Pi Phi workshops many beautiful crafts are produced by proessionals as well those who are attempting to acquire .n inner satisfaction with a craft as a sideline. There may )e a therapeutic value this summer a blind girl took )ottery; a soon-to-be retired doctor was apparently searchng for a future way of self-expression. The aesthetic -alue was obviously being sought by several. Art super-'isors came for refresher courses, students to complete Eegrees. Each year I am more proud of the final exhibit 'feces. Much credit for this attainment is given our Work-hop Director, Marian Heard, who for eighteen years has lemanded that there be a high standard of workmanship. Perhaps you are a Pi Phi, hoping to come to Workshop onetime (many express that wish), and wondering a bit bout the advantages of handcrafts.

We promptly put them all to work, and they responded beautifully. On the recommendation of our architect, Mr. James M. Battersby, AIA, of Knoxville, Illinois, we had (1) four round steel columns put in the northwest corner of the basement to shore up the beams and joists; (2) the floors on the first floor levelled and refinished; and (3) the east exterior wall brushed and repainted where the paint was peeling. Mrs. Hines, our hostess at Holt House, reports the refinished floors look lovely. We had sad news in the fact that we lost four trees to the dutch elm disease last summer. They have been removed, but will also have to be replaced. The kitchen cabinets have new hardware, which is the first since the original restoration. A Holt House sign has been placed on Broadway, the main street in Monmouth, thanks to the efforts of Cleone Barnes Rawson, the Monmouth member of our committee. We have had complaints about the lack of such a sign for many years, and are grateful for her work in securing per-mission to have one. At the fall meeting of the Holt House committee we hired Mrs. Ada Willer-Peterson, AID, of Chicago to help with the long range planning and redecorating of Holt House. We hope to repaper the dining room and Pine room this summer, and put up new curtains in both rooms. The decorator has sent sample boxes to the committee, from which they are to make their selection. Next year we hope to do the parlor and hall. Our aim is to have Holt House in A-1 condition by the Centennial in 1967. From May 1, 1962 to April 30, 1963 Holt House was used 128 times, 17 of them by Pi Phis. We have purposely kept the rentals low so more clubs and individuals would feel they could use it. In this way we feel it is helping to serve the purpose to which our Founders aspired. Many clubs use it as a regular meeting place, and we have had several wedding receptions this year. Forty-seven chapters and clubs have used the slides for programs this year, This is a record! If you haven't seen them, try to schedule them this fall. They are most interesting and informative, and a script accompanies them. Send your requests in early to Miss Margaret Dick, 288 Southmoreland, Decatur, Illinois. Pi Province North sent us 5 green stamp books, and with them plus some others we had, we were able to purchase a copper kitchen clock, and a large coffee maker. The latter delighted all the clubs, because they formerly had to furnish their own. Marion Keck Simmons sent four books which are quite an addition to our library. A 100% record of contributions last year from the active chapters was a first. Only 8 alumni clubs refrained from donating. We hope we will have 100% from both this year. Your contributions are necessary to keep Holt House in tip top shape. For those of you who have never visited Holt House, I hope someday you may. It is lovely, and the ideals it symbolizes are worth everything we can do to keep them going.

Canada. The 1962 mmittee shipped all their files here where they were ven a thorough cleaning, and an inventory was made, More shipping them on to the members of the new cornittee. The procedure notebooks and reports submitted by e 1962 committee were excellent and will be of great due in this year's planning. We continue to receive brochures from hotels in the nited States and in Canada, and invitations from Cham-.rs of Commerce or Convention Bureaus. Among the ter are communications from Honolulu, Vienna, Austria, aerto Rico and Nassau. Many places are not suitable and .nnot be considered, but further investigation is made of .e sites which seem to offer facilities which meet our reairements. The Grand Council makes the final decisions a the places to be investigated, and is responsible for the 'lection of the site of each convention. In November, a trip was made to Minneapolis, Chicago Id St. Louis for the purpose of investigating the Learning-41, the Edgewater Beach, and the Chase-Park Plaza Hotels. eports of these visits were submitted to the Grand Count and as a result, the Edgewater Beach Hotel was chosen ,r the 1966 convention. A tentative "hold" was put on dates in 1970 at the Broadmoor Hotel in Colorado Springs. Early in April a trip was arranged to visit the Empress Hotel in Victoria. En route, we stopped over at the Broad-moor in Colorado Springs for a tour of the hotel's facilities and a conference with the Executive Assistant Manager. The entire committee met together at the Empress and during our three day stay, we toured the hotel, met with the convention manager, made preliminary plans for the convention, and net also with the Pi Phis living in Victoria. This was a most successful meeting, for the members of the committee could continue to work together in night sessions after very full and busy days. At the request of the Grand President, we made chapter visits in March to Iowa Alpha, Iowa Beta and South Dakota Alpha. It was a pleasure to be able to assume this added responsibility this year, and once again to have personal contact with Pi Beta Phi chapters. The gracious hospitality of these chapters, and of the alumni whom it was our pleasure to meet, was greatly appreciated. It is a privilege to serve Pi Beta Phi in this capacity, and we wish to expsess our grateful appreciation to the members of the Grand Council, under whose direction it is a pleasure to work. HELEN ANDERSON LEWIS Settlement Lot 1912-1962 SETTLEMENT SCHOOL COMMITTEE Fifty-one years of Settlement School service and growth have passed. A sixth decade of hope and planning for the future has begun. Vision for the fraternity years ahead is centered, in part, upon the momentous decision that will be made at the 1964 Convention. At that time fraternity representatives will decide whether our present Memorial to The Founders of Pi Beta Phi, The Settlement School, is worthy of new focus, fresh investment, and perhaps a new name as a Centennial Project. In this last committee report to be available before that recision is made, we wish to combine last year's developments and traditional inclusions with a discussion of certain aspects of our present philanthropy as they pertain to the forthcoming Centennial decision. Surely 5 conscientious alumnre working 365 days a year for 5 continuous years acquire considerable knowledge of the past heritage, present trend and future potential of the project supervised. Thus we offer no apology for our discussion it is based on first-hand knowledge which we desire to share. This year, we just hope our readers will be many due to that important Centennial decision just ahead! Of the four projects to be considered on a fraternity-wide basis in 1964, one is allied to the Settlement School and the other three involve new endeavors. As the Settlement School proposal concerns an existing fraternity project, it seems imperative that convention delegates have a comprehensive understanding of our present Memorial as a basis for project discussion and vote. Thorough knowledge of what we have now is essential for a wise and sound decision regardless of the outcome. This is basic and logical. The Major Factor Education Approved at the 1910 Convention and in existence by 1912, the fraternity's educational philanthropy has a fascinating history. This is not the time for historical review except as it serves to point up various shifts in educational focus, and to clarify several aspects of the total endeavor not always understood. First, a point of semantics. The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School is the proper name for the en-tire enterprise all of it. It is the name under which it was qualified as an educational institution and one that will undoubtedly continue until officially changed by the fraternity. The correct name to use when speaking of the school only is The Pi Beta Phi School. It leads to confusion to say settlement in this connection. It should be clear that the Pi Beta Phi School is and always has been a public school in the Sevier County School District. Gatlinburg does not have a separate school district. The Pi Beta Phi School is the only school in Gatlinburg, and the children who attend are about equal in number from within the town limits and from a wide-spread rural area. Another point to understand is that there have been shifting degrees of control and support throughout the school's history. In 1912-13 the fraternity and the county each provided separate, short, school sessions which made an awkward and inadequate situation. Then an agreement was reached that if the immediate community indicated its interest in better education by raising 2/3 of the cost of land for the school and the desired settlement, the fraternity would assume complete responsibility, build a new school, and provide good teachers. This was done and so began an arrangement that prevailed until 1943. During this period there was some county supplement. The fraternityadded a high school building in 1928 that marked the beginning of a 12-grade curriculum. In the 1930's, work on the adjacent Great Smokies National Park progressed rapidly. One result of this was an increase in the county's tax base, due mainly to the growth of tourist accommodations in Gatlinburg, a major park entrance and exit. The fraternity felt that the time had come for the county to resume basic education costs at the Pi Beta Phi School, and for the fraternity to assume a supplemental role by providing certain teachers which the county could not then, and still cannot now, afford tc employ on a county-wide basis. Since 1943, we have leased the playground and two school buildings to the county fol. $1 per year. During World War II years, student enrollment bulged there as elsewhere, and the. need for a new grade school and more adequate gymnasium-cafeteria facilities to meet rising standards became acute. The cost of land adjoining the fraternity school property was prohibitive for the county, and the fraternity agreed to assist these worthwhile efforts by deeding 1.8 acres for $1 to the county for school building purposes. In 1949, a new 50-year lease was negotiated to adjust to the deeded property, The expected buildings were erected shortly after. In 1961 both deed and lease were corrected to conform to a new fraternity land survey. These are the shifts in major educational support and control, from county to fraternity and back to county, and the related property adjustments. In the meantime, the Pi Beta Phi School changed from an elementary school to a combination elementary-high school, and due to a ,development this past year it is to become an elementary school again! For 3 years we have been hearing about consolidation of the Pi Beta Phi and Pitman Center High Schools. Rathel unexpectedly, the vote of necessary funds came late in 1962. Plans and building have moved quickly and the new school will open this fall at a new site outside Gatlin-burg. Thus the Pi Beta Phi School will serve grades 1-8 again. With the departure of the last high school class to graduate from the Pi Beta Phi School, it was a tribute to the Settlement School Director and to the Fraternity she represents that Marion Mueller was asked to give the Commencement Address! As women are not usually ac-corded such distinctive recognition, this was a special mark of esteem! Consolidation posed several pertinent questions for the fraternity that had to be decided rather quickly. Briefly, the decisions were: (1) terminate Woodworking classes fox high school boys; (2) continue Art-Crafts and Music classes for grades 1-8, on a part-time basis if possible; (3) continue dormitory program on a yearly evaluative basis; (4) continue school nurse services at the Pi Beta Phi and Glades Schools but not extend to the new high school and lastly, (5) terminate the Grace Coolidge Library in the high school building. In this latter regard, we gave all 1949 lease books to the county for distribution to the new high school or to the homerooms of the remaining elementary teachers. We shall establish a new Grace Coolidv Collection at the Staff House to replace the former high school library. This will permit better control than possible since 1943, and as this change has been anticipated for the past few years, all recent accessions have been care-fully retained by the Director! We are very grateful to the Pittsburgh Alumna. Club for its timely, special gift which will be used for appropriate bookcases to contain the new Collection and for the related, necessary redecoration of the 27 8 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI ving room. It is our belief that this plan to honor Mrs. :oolidge's memory is dignified, practical, and forward-)oking in its concept. Concerning our teachers, we are pleased to announce that le new Art and Crafts teacher will be Miss Mary Ruth mith who attended the Craft Workshop this summer and as just attained her master's degree at the University of 'ennessee. We regret a midsummer release-from-contract quested by Mr. Glenn Terry who had such fine Music lasses last year, and only hope a suitable replacement can e found at this late date. It was a sad decision to close 23-year association with Mr. Carl L. Huskey, the Woodiorking teacher. The integrity, knowledge and skill with Thich he taught the young men in his classes is deeply ppreciated by all fraternity members who have known him. (Tith these changes, Education at the Pi Beta Phi School is rought up-to-date. The current degree of educational suport there will be a factor in the Centennial decision. It is necessary to go back to the early 1940's to trace the evelopment of the latest Educational development The ;raft Workshop. As this is the one with which the Cen-Innial decision is concerned it is important to understand .ow and why it began. Along with the anticipated release f supervision and major support of the Pi Beta Phi chool, it was imperative to consider replacement of that ducational loss with a new endeavor that would retain the ducational status of the philanthropy and the property. ~wo independent surveys pointed the way. They noted hat the Arrowcraft project already had recognized, preerved and promoted the native crafts indigenous to the rea; that Arrowcraft's specialty, Handweaving, had proven is value in nation-wide interest within and outside the raternity; and recommended a new educational project at he adult level to increase craft artistry and skill and at the ame time provide meaningful recognition for a broadened, nigher educational interest. The University of Tennessee vhich has a strong Department of Related Art and Crafts within the College of Home Economics was approached nd became interested. After several years of discussion nd planning, the jointly-sponsored summer Craft Work-hops were launched in 1945. After 19 years, not only has he Craft Workshop come of age, it has grown to maturity with consistently increasing success, recognition and reputaion. There are several most interesting aspects of the Craft Workshop to note. A statistical compilation of 19 years of Craft Workshop s food for thought regarding extent of interest and appeal: Totals : 1945-63 Individual Students 1405 Class Enrollments 3698 States D.C. Represented 43 Foreign Countries Represented 12 Foreign Students Enrolled 27 Different Classes Offered 18 The co-sponsored Pi Phi-UT Craft Workshop is unique nd an unusual association of a university and a fraternity, specially when viewed from either traditional area of inerest. A recent university survey, while involving a few ainor adjustments, has provided assurance to Pi Beta Phi f continued interest in the present program and, more mportant, an interest in expanded services in connection with it. All national and province officers can attest to this mportant point for reflection in Centennial thinking, due o the talks given by Dean Lura M. Odland and Miss Ieard in Gatlinburg last summer. Past co-sponsoring relationships have always been most ,leasant, productive to progress and mutually helpful in very way. With this background and expressed interest a further expansion of co-sponsored education, fraternity aembers may be assured of continued valuable association. University standards for both undergraduate and grad-ate work have prevailed in all classes throughout Craft Workshop history. High standards that are maintained andconstantly improved are a mark of quality education in any field. This has been an important factor in the excellent reputation the Craft Workshop has attained, and would continue in all co-sponsored new endeavors. The college credit aspect should not be overlooked. This implication in co-sponsorship should be immediately evident. The present program or any future expanded pro-gram with college credit for people who want it would be impossible for the fraternity to achieve alone. The fraternity's prior investment in buildings already having an Art-Craft purpose should be mentioned. We cite particularly the last 3 buildings to be developed all having this focus in mind: (1) the Staff House in 1952 for better resident and instructional staff housing plus better kitchen-dining facilities to handle 75 people easily; (2) the Red Barn renovated in 1959 to replace the old schoolhouse dormitory, plus two meeting rooms; (3) the Weaving Studio in 1962 to provide our first year-around classroom. These are existing assets. When the planned Ceramics Wing can be afforded for the Weaving Studio, there will be two classrooms. For minimum year-around facilities, office space and 4 more classrooms will be needed before -withdrawal from the Pi Beta Phi School rooms. Considering what we already have, six new rooms are not many to need for conversion. The fraternity also has an existing asset in Art-Craft equipment. A fair estimate of this value is approximately $16,000. Some new equipment would be needed, of course, for year-around services but such expense should not be excessive. All in all, the fraternity has a very good and sound prior Art-Craft investment at the Settlement School upon which to build a new philanthropic program. One-week concentrated Craft Workshop courses (3) were a successful experiment this past summer and will probably be offered again in 1964. This kind of class had considerable appeal, we learned, for people having just two weeks for combined work-vacation-travel. It might have co-sponsor and single-sponsor implications for special purpose groups several times during the year. Specific planning of what, when, and for whom should follow the decision, however, not precede it. We can only analyse and explore for the present. The Pi Beta Phi-sponsored classes certainly need discussion on an existing and a projected basis. These classes began in 1959 after the Red Barn became available. More were requested the next year, and during the past year 7 different adult classes met one or more times a week, over a several month time span to conclude all of them. Such classes could be stretched out or made more concentrated at will. Some could even be offered for children in after-school hours or on Saturdays. There are many talented and creative craft people living in the area and they have provided the instruction. These classes have been excellent public relations, with social overtones that are good for the fraternity too. Concentrated one-day workshops or a series of lectures could be planned for organizations having a related craft interest, many of whom hold regular conventions in Gatlinburg. Educational activities sponsored by Pi Beta Phi would certainly have an important place in the overall expanded program. As with co-sponsored developments, these too would have to be planned more specifically if the green light is given. The many values inherent in the Art-Craft field will be discussed in the Director's Report only this year. As this is a big subject in itself, it was previously planned that the two reports would not duplicate this material. Please refer to the Settlement School Director's Report in this same issue for these very important coverages. The desired correlation between a local project and a national project is extremely good for the Settlement School proposal if a little thought and research are given to it. That is the beauty of the proposition the variety of application that can be made. For example, consider a specific craft service for a specific age group, a specific THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 29 7 handicap group, mentally retarded children or mentally ill adults each of these in the local situation. Consider a new program for an established community agency, a new service for the local community center, or an annual subsidy for an existing craft program that limps along because of lack of funds for materials. Consider too a new, local Pi Phi Scholarship to a new national Pi Phi Craft School sponsored by a club or a province and even joint club-chapter. Consider an annual craft art show with cash awards for the best entries. Consider old folks homes those forgotten people who too often just sit and wait with no hope or interest. These thoughts are just to open the "thinking door" to the numerous opportunities that are feasible and characteristic of this comparatively new field for interest and service. It is very exciting to think about the many different ways 320 clubs and 109 chapters could develop a local project in direct relationship to this Centennial proposal! The fact of an existing resident personnel needing only a fraternity directive to place conversion in effect is an asset that should be remembered. In other words, since there is personnel already familiar with a trend in the same direction as the project proposal, a going concern for the 100th anniversary of Pi Beta Phi could easily be in effect when 1967 arrives. There would be no time lag to get ready to get set to go ! It is always interesting to know the Pi Phis attending the Craft Workshop each year. The 1963 winner of the Albuquerque Alumna Club Scholarship was Patricia Ann Hamilton, Chapter President of New Mexico Alpha. Sandra Kay Martin, Texas Delta, won the Virginia Alpha Craft Work-shop Scholarship. The Graduate Assistant Scholarships awarded to Pi Phis were won by Sheila Smith of Manitoba Alpha and Margaret Miller of Indiana Zeta, If only more Pi Phi actives from near and far could enjoy this fraternity experience together every summer as these four girls did! Other Pi Phis enjoying the experience were Lorine Pruette, Ph.D. Tennessee Alpha; Ruth Spelman Illinois Epsilon; Marion Mueller Indiana Gamma. Marian G. Heard, Professor of Craft Design at UT and Convention Initiate in 1954, completed her 17th year as most capable, hard working Director of the Craft Workshop. The fraternity owes her and her staff a great debt for another fine year of leader-ship. As we conclude the report and direction of the Pi Beta Phi School and the Craft Workshop, it is worth remembering that twelve girls' concern for Education first brought our Founders together. It was singularly fitting that the fraternity's 50th year Memorial to them should be an education service, The Settlement School. It would be even more fitting if the 100th year Memorial could continue an educational purpose by building upon a past heritage and investment to establish a new kind of school one that is more specialized, creative, and an increasingly needed educational service in the increasingly automated society of the present and fore-seeable future. The Health Center The health work at the Settlement School was 43 years old this year. It was another fine year though somewhat different than usual in that the work done there was by two nurses instead of one! Mrs. Marjorie Chalmers, Illinois B-A, retired on December 1 after 27 continuous years of devoted and capable service. Brenda Allison, R.N., arrived on November 10 for several weeks of on-spot training with Marjorie before assuming sole responsibility which she has done most ably ever since. As usual, physical examinations were given to all children at the Pi Beta Phi and Glades Schools. Audiometer tests were given to children in the 2nd, 4th and 6th grades. Measles, mumps and chicken pox were prevalent during the school year, and almost 40% of the student body was absent at one time with influenza. Referrals were varied speech, eye and hearing defects, retardation, a severe case ofstrabismus, and spinal abnormality. The Friday Well-Baby Clinics continue and are especially well attended in good weather. The committee was astounded to learn that during the annual meeting, 30 children attended one Friday and 29 the other. The Health Center was a noisy place those days but good to witness! Various chapters of Sigma Phi Gamma sent a total of $135 for the Corrective Fund of the Health Center. As a rule though not always, most of the indigent cases requiring corrective treatment can be handled from these welcome contributions. Used clothing has been a special need this year. Also we like to keep the Loan Cupboard filled and not bare! We asked Nurse Brenda what she needed most and she replied: "Little boys' pants up to size 6, little girls' dresses up to size 6, good used shoes, and baby clothes." Jackets for children are welcome also. If any Pi Phi has surplus clothing of this kind, please send it to Miss Allison at the Health Center where it will be greatly appreciated. The statistical service record for the year is as follows: Field visits 324 Office calls 3789 Service given 3439 Small pox vaccinations 170 Typhoid injections 572 Triple vaccine (diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus) 276 Salk vaccine 333 Sabin oral vaccine 8 Tetanus toxoid 66 Therapeutic injections 211 Tuberculin tests 408 Chest X-rays 369 Physical examinations and inspections 1222 Audiometer tests 189 Teacher-Nurse conferences 321 Health Talks 31 Family conferences 269 Newspaper articles ... . 14 The role of the Jennie Nicol Health Center in a new kind of school would need thought, and there might be merit to continuing for these reasons. The cost to continue would mainly be the annual salary of one nurse as at present. From one person's services would come three benefits: continued protection to the fraternity of having a resident nurse in a new year-around school; continued service available to the community where our health work began, where many indigent families still rely on it and where this new school would still be; and continued service to the children of the adjacent school bearing the Pi Beta Phi name. Public relations would be implicit in this decision, as would the Jennie Nicol name within the fraternity. The Dormitory Program As stated earlier, this program will henceforth be evaluated annually due to the departure of high school students from the Pi Beta Phi School. It is impossible to foresee all effects but there is no doubt that attending school 5 miles away will bring changes. Thus the decision to examine it closely in the next year or two. There has been a dormitory program at the Settlement School since 1919, and the total number of young people benefited by it is approximately 650. This is such a personal guidance program that it is always difficult to state its values simply. Briefly, they include the whole range of young people's problems everywhere: right companionship, sufficient and proper food to grow on, privacy, need for supervised study, encouragement to finish high school and participate in worthwhile activities, guidance in earning money, a good private talk now and then, and so on. Mrs. Mueller says this is the most challenging part of her work, and yet it is least suitable to wide publicity. Accepted students pay $7 a month and augment this token fee with several hours of work each week, so there are mutual benefits. In the main, however, this program is subsidized by annual contributions, Magazine commissions and Arrow-craft net income, together with special gifts which augment. Even if evaluation should point the way to conclusion, and further, if the Centennial project should come, we ques30 THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI Eon the wisdom of closing our dormitory doors completely. Surely the composite heart of Pi Beta Phi is large enough to make i-oom for a few most needy young people each year, whether or not we call it a standing program. Ruth Spelman completed her 5th year as capable, genial housemother for the girls at Stuart Dormitory and, most happily, will continue next year. Lela Adams will continue her dual work as matron of the boys' dormitory and Staff House cook. Marion Mueller, of course, will again fill her "challenging" role as program director most capably and attentively as she similarly fills each of her numerous and varied responsibilities. Brendel Fund income was used to provide music lessons for certain dorm students. The Alspaugh Scholarship ($200) was awarded to Ronnie Moore for advanced study in art. Unfortunately, three dormitory boys added their statistics to the national drop-out problem, due to factors beyond our control. Viewing the year as a whole, it was another worthwhile and productive year to add to those that have preceded it. The Arrowcraft Shop The new look at the Arrowcraft Shop this year concerned people! On November 15, Maria Hutchins Tate, Florida Beta, arrived to begin her duties as Manager. She has been warmly welcomed by both shop and resident staffs, and we hope she will be with us a long time. Wino-gene Redding who helped inaugurate the Arrowcraft project in 1926 retired in mid-May. She had 4 different employment periods as Weaving Designer, and her many years of interest and service at Arrowcraft are very appreciated. Mrs. Corinne Purdom arrived on June 10 to start her responsibilities as Weaving Designer, having a fine back-ground for this unique position which involves creative designing for quantity production. It is always nice to have continuing personnel: Elizabeth Rue, Iowa Gamma, as cordial Manager of the Mountain View Hotel Shop, Eunice Cole as Bookkeeper, Nella Hill as Assistant to Mrs. Purdom, Faye Cook as Head of Shipping assisted by Gene Hembree, and Shirley Roberts and June Cook as salesgirls. We have a very fine, competent and cooperative staff of 8 regular employees at the Arrowcraft Shop. Shelves and storage places are bulging with beautiful handweaving and other interesting crafts, ready and waiting for another busy fall shipping season. Alumnx. club orders are, and always have been, the mainstay of Arrowcraft. Again we wish to say "thank you" to every Pi Phi who individually or collectively continues to provide needed work for 60 to 70 weavers annually, as well as to provide sizable outlets for other craftsmen. There was a fine increase in club sales both in weaving and other crafts and this is encouraging. Stress should continue to be on weaving for this is the Arrowcraft specialty. While many smaller clubs participate magnificently in the Arrowcraft project, it has long been a "friendly competition" tradition to name those clubs remitting over $1000 for Arrowcraft products during the past years, as follows: Champaign-Urbana $3,313.28 San Antonio $1,445.36 Akron 2,479.77 Beaumont 1,416.09 Pittsburgh 2,237.74 Warren-Youngstown 1,361.98 North Shore 2,209.97 Albuquerque 1,353.68 Wichita 2,085.13 Indianapolis 1,333.57 Philadelphia-Main Ardmore 1,305.73 Line 1,823.47 Northern New Jersey Berkeley 1,768.38 1,227.90 Bloomfield Hills 1,742.16 Gary 1,127.51 Arlington Heights 1,726.89 Chattanooga 1,116.15 South Bend 1,678.54 Milwaukee 1,099.53 Oklahoma City 1,656.06 Fayetteville 1,053.27 Stillwater 1,635.79 Cleveland East 1,042.94 Columbus, Ohio . 1,620.03 South Hills 1,040.12 Denver 1,546.11 Baltimore 1,015.00 Schenectady 1,462.60 Harrisburg-Carlyle 1,006.68 Periodically it seems necessary to remind clubs and chapters to please pay their Arrowcraft bills promptly. (Our auditors scolded the committee rather severely aboutthat this year so it is our role to be the spokesman in this matter.) It helps most when bills are paid by invoice as soon as a shipment is received and checked. Next best is payment within 60 days from date of shipment. This can be stretched to 90 days if necessary. The rub comes when accounts are not paid in full by the end of the fiscal year (May 31), and worse, if carried for a year or more. It might clarify Arrowcraft's need for prompt payment to state that while clubs and chapters may charge, Arrow-craft may not! Everything must be paid for before it is shipped. We are all in this together and when there is real need for an extension of time, a written explanation will help. With understanding and cooperation, the present plan can be continued and we all can look forward to an even better year for Arrowcraft in 1963-64. Readers might like to know in advance of the 1964 Convention that it is our present understanding we may not have an Arrowcraft sale at Victoria next summer. So the plan is to have an extensive Arrowcraft Exhibit instead. That will be one convention where a notebook will be more valuable than a pocketbook! Other Information Of The Year There were fewer 100% Provinces in Contributions to the Settlement School this year compared to last 1 less among clubs and 5 less among chapters. We believe the May 31 end of fiscal year at the Settlement School to be a factor in this drop, and urge annual reminders of this dateline. 100% provinces this year were: Clubs Chapters Both Alpha Alpha Alpha Delta Beta Delta Eta Gamma Iota Iota Delta Xi Kappa Theta Pi South Xi Iota Omicron Mu Pi South Xi Pi Alumna. Club Contributions sent to the Settlement School Treasurer totaled $12,175.24, a very welcome in-crease of $635.71 over the previous year. In addition, certain clubs sent $197 to the Director for special use. This increased support and confidence is most heartening. In keeping with a friendly tradition, the record follows of those clubs giving $150 or over, with number of consecutive years since 1949 in parentheses: Pittsburgh $1,300.00 Schenectady $175.00 Kansas City (14) ... 1,000.00 Northern New jersey St. Louis (14) . .. 770.00 (3) 150.00 Cleveland East (2) 375.00 Philadelphia-Delco 150.00 North Shore (6) 367.00 Columbus, Ohio (2) . 150.00 Pasadena (6) 309.00 Arlington Heights (4) 150.00 Indianapolis (14) .. 270.00 .................. . Omaha 233.50 Everett (7) 150.00 Westchester Co. (4) . 200.00 South Coast, Calif. ... 150.00 Los Angeles 200.00 While regretting the loss of 6 clubs having started a nice sequence, we welcome an equal number of new clubs to the fold! The above 17 clubs gave 47% of total contributions this year. Many thanks to them as to the many other clubs who gave equally well and even more in pro-portion to their size. All clubs will be interested to learn of a change in Soaring Pigeon Awards next year. Hence-forth these awards for both club contributions and Arrow-craft remittances will be made on a basis of club member-ship for the year. The groupings to be used are: up through 24, 25-49, 50-74, 75-99, 100 and over. To equalize the total number of club and chapter awards, the latter will be increased to the 10 highest in chapter contributions. We believe these to be very good changes for these tokens of recognition and appreciation, even though club winners will be much more difficult to determine. From $3,136.55 received in Chapter Contributions by the Treasurer, part will be used for operating expenses and $1,560.77 will be added to the Settlement School Endowment Fund for a 1963 total of $81,744.18. As THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 31 this year's chapter gifts were $270.21 less than the prior year and involved 5 less 100% provinces, the May 31 fiscal year may again be a factor. Our thanks go to all chapters who donated on time and also to the 2 chapters giving $42.48 to the Director for special purposes. Honorable mention for chapters traditionally is for $100 or more. Chapters thus recognized, with consecutive years, are: Nevada A (2) $175.00 Missouri B (13) $100.00 Texas A. (2) 150.00 Nebraska B (2) 100.00 Texas I' (8) 150.00 Montana A 100.00 Alabama B (4) 100.00 In addition to the annual cash donations from clubs and chapters that are so essential, many Pi Phis make generous contributions to the Settlement School each year. Though individually recorded, such gifts may be designated for club or chapter credit if desired, and they provide personal tax exemptions. Many other gifts of goods, magazines, books, Christmas remembrances and TV or SH stamps were received. All are welcome and provide nice surprises! Magazine Commissions in the amount of $8,351.70 were received and we are very grateful to the Magazine Chair-men who worked so hard to attain this total. Two years ago magazine commissions were approaching equal status with club contributions, but since then they have dropped over $2,900-to our considerable financial concern. Is it too much to ask every Pi Phi to review her own magazine subscriptions in the light of fraternity loyalty? Memorial Fund gifts this year came to $325, of which $55 was from clubs honoring a deceased member. Instead of sending flowers, a contribution to this fund is a meaningful, fraternity way to express love and tribute. Notifications of two bequests to the Settlement School were received this year, with payments to be made following probate. One was a bequest from the will of Ruth Kathryn Shoudy, Washington Beta, in the amount of $500. The other was a legacy of $2,000 from the estate of Anna Marie DeCastello in honor of her mother, Anna Many DeCastello, a charter member of Iowa Sigma. Pi Beta Phi in the lives of both former members must have been very personal, sincere and longlasting and it is an honor for the Settlement School to be remembered in this way. The May L. Keller Award for the best chapter program on the Settlement School was awarded this year to Ruth Sullivan of Alabama Alpha. The committee always finds this a very interesting though diffi-:,alt selection to make, only wishing that every chapter sent its best program of the year for consideration. Improvements made at the Settlement School this year were: acoustical ceiling for the dining room, rewiring of Pollard Cottage, new art tables and renovation of the Emma Harper Turner building, air-conditioners for the Weaving Studio where classwork is a very warm activity, new screen doors at the Red Barn, various indoor and outside painting, a new hedge along Pi Phi lane, and new drainage tiling where needed. Then too, there is always this and that to fix! The changing status of real property owned by and providing so-called "competitive business" income for educational, religious and charitable institutions is well known. It extends across the land. Last year the Arrowcraft portion of the property was assessed for ad valorem taxes for the first time in its history. Thorough review of a 1962 state Supreme Court case involving a comparable situation was so convincing of this trend that to instigate an appeal would have been futile. Even though this tax is not prohibitive it marks a new status for that corner plot of the property. It also serves as a sharp reminder that no presenteducational or related-service endeavor may be released until something to take its place is firmly entrenched. The afterglow of that wonderful Smithsonian Institution Exhibit, the highlight of the Settlement School's 50th anniversary, was evidently bright throughout the fraternity all year. In retrospect it is still quite remarkable that The National Museum of the United States should pay a full month's tribute to Pi Beta Phi for its Arrowcraft and Craft Workshop phases of work at the Settlement School. There should be implications for the future as we reflect upon the stature of that recognition. The committee had another busy and interesting year. The Settlement School Program Guide was completed and sent to all chapters and clubs last fall. As this was planned for ready reference in program planning, we sincerely hope it is used and not just filed away! Secretary Lois Over-street Summers did a fine job with Minutes compiled in both Washington and Gatlinburg; she greatly assisted the chairman all through the year and also wrote numerous thank-you notes for the committee. Eloise Glazner Hensley compiled a fine new slides program (this is done every year), and had much correspondence to schedule this and the convention program among clubs and chapters for the best slides year ever recorded. Sally Bosman Schneiter came through her first year as Treasurer with flying colors, and is eager to receive at any time those nice envelopes containing checks! Sally Wild Gordon assumed her Publicity work with ease the Fall letter to clubs and chapters, Little Pigeon News articles, and distribution of large glossies for display and publicity purposes. The entire committee wishes to assist any club or chapter in every possible way. There is this reminder: when a specific date is involved for information, a slides program or publicity material, please write as early as possible. The fullness of the past year was made immeasurably easier and nicer by the assistance of all Grand Council members, but especially by the thoughtful and prompt guidance given by our adviser, Olivia Smith Moore. We also wish to thank her for another of her "little stock gifts" so quietly given for a third time. It is a very sincere pleasure to welcome Dorothy Cole-man Thorman, Illinois Epsilon, as the new Chairman of the Settlement School Committee. She brings a fine fraternity background to the position as former Iota Alumnae Province President and former Chairman of Manuals. This experience combined with her numerous personal abilities promise outstanding leadership in the important Settlement School years ahead. Close association with the Settlement School is a privilege the retiring chairman wishes might be shared by every Pi Phi. It has brought appreciation of just how much continuous fraternity loyalty and investment can accomplish. It has brought realization of the worth of a past heritage in planning a future course. When Libbie Brook Gaddis accepted the Settlement School for the Founders in 1918, she said, "We are overwhelmed when we think of the honor you have conferred upon us in permitting the Settlement School to stand as a Memorial to your Founders." With a fresh look at the words "to stand as a Memorial to your Founders," it has brought a strong conviction that the Centennial Project proposal for the Settlement School is more than something feasible and realistic, it is the right decision for the fraternity. It is a keeping of faith with the Founders of Pi Beta Phi that the Settlement School shall continue to stand in new ways to serve the educational needs of a changing society. HELEN MOFFETT RUSSELL, Chairman t THE ARROW OF P1 BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL DIRECTOR'S REPORT atlinburg The village of Gatlinburg borders the Great Smoky [ountain National Park, hence is ideally located to accom-Lodate many tourists. Since World War II the facilities ave increased to the extent that over six thousand tourists Lay obtain housing in one of many motels, or in one of le four hotels. Yet the census reports slightly over two sousand population for the village. Highways 441 and 73 rovide the route of scenic beauty as one approaches Gatnburg and remains the predominant attraction to the tea. In the heart of Gatlinburg on the Parkway (Highways 41 and 73), one notices the Pi Beta Phi Arrowcraft Shop, i Beta Phi-University of Tennessee Workshop, Health enter, and Settlement School signs. Entering the school the one leaves the frequently bumper-to-bumper traffic nd notes the Pi Beta Phi buildings. For an armchair tour f the grounds it is logical to stop at the Loom House ihich was completed in June of 1962. raft Workshops The Craft Center with one large wing accommodating pproximately thirty looms serves as weaving studio and lassroom during summer workshop. Adult craft classes wet there during the winter months. Classes in weaving, apestry weaving and rug making, jewelry, stitchery and ottery have proved very popular with students both locally nd from nearby towns including two from North Caroina and two from Georgia. Many have shown interest in uture craft classes. With the Prouty gift at 1962 Convention contributing oward a future ceramic wing, naturally our thoughts turn o the future possibilities. These admittedly are dreams at resent; however, I think we can honestly classify some of hese "possibilities" as "needs." Manpower and money are vasted in shifting from winter school setup to summer vorkshop and vice versa. Moving heavy equipment adds o the risk of breakage. Emphasis might well be directed therwise toward a permanent setup. Handcrafts are not new. Yes, Pi Phi pioneered in reiving weaving in this Appalachian area, yet crafts have ,een made since early history. The Bible refers to the wool and flax weaver "She maketh fine linen, and selleth t." Pottery also served for utilitarian purposes as well as conomic in Biblical times. Now crafts have an indispensable place in culture also. ['he religious motifs the madonna, the cross, crucifix, tar, and three kings are frequently used. At our Pi Phi workshops many beautiful crafts are produced by proessionals as well those who are attempting to acquire .n inner satisfaction with a craft as a sideline. There may )e a therapeutic value this summer a blind girl took )ottery; a soon-to-be retired doctor was apparently searchng for a future way of self-expression. The aesthetic -alue was obviously being sought by several. Art super-'isors came for refresher courses, students to complete Eegrees. Each year I am more proud of the final exhibit 'feces. Much credit for this attainment is given our Work-hop Director, Marian Heard, who for eighteen years has lemanded that there be a high standard of workmanship. Perhaps you are a Pi Phi, hoping to come to Workshop onetime (many express that wish), and wondering a bit bout the advantages of handcrafts. They may be summed ip briefly as follows: Crafts develop skill provide a creative outlet may be a form of recreation increase sensitiveness to surroundings and give dignity to common things frequently bring out unsuspected abilities furnish aesthetic satisfaction and are pathways to wonder and beauty that form a link between nature and art explain and help rationalize the machine bring the handicapped into better adjustments. The economic, aesthetic, educational and therapeutic values overlap into almost any craft program. Not many folks get into trouble while working. It's the leisure time or free time which must be watched. Handcrafts taken up as recreation may be the answer. According to mountaineer terminology I'm "right proud" of our summer Craft Workshop. It is amazing and inspiring to see so many students with such varied interests work for similar goals. In February or March workshop information is sent to each Alumnae Club and Active Chapter using Central Office addressograph listing. If your Club or Chapter does not receive a brochure and letter, kindly inform my office. Our sincere wish is that many more Pi Phis could participate in this nationally, and internationally-known project. Scholarships may be made available through Clubs and other sources. Through this endeavor there are end-less opportunities for Pi Phi to broaden the horizons at Settlement School. Arrowcraft Shop Our Arrowcraft Shop sells many different crafts from the Southern Highlands. Weaving still remains the specialty of the shop. With the many Club sales (small ones count, too !), there is great evidence of the loyalty of many Pi Phi members who not only give hours but years in this voluntary work. Settlement School staff is aware of this, and deep appreciation is extended to every Pi Phi who participates. In the Settlement School Chairman's report the results of sales will be given. Arrowcraft averages sixty weavers who bring their products to the shop for sale throughout the year. This represents a large sum which has an economic influence some weaving to supplement their husband's income, others making it their livelihood. Maria Lou Tate, Florida Beta, came as manager of Arrow-craft in November, and is proving most capable. June 10 (the first day of summer workshop) Corrine Purdom began her duties as weaving designer for Arrowcraft. This job is a difficult one to fill, yet with Corrine's Master's Degree in Weaving, gradually new items should appear. Since the price list is effective for one year, radical changes cannot be made mid-year. Perhaps one of the greatest honors that has ever come to Arrowcraft and our Pi Beta Phi-University of Tennessee Workshop was the invitation to display weaving in the Textile Division of the Smithsonian Institute for one month in 1962. Many Pi Phis who attended the Convention in Washington had the privilege of seeing this large exhibit in the Rotunda. The request for some of the weaving to be in a permanent collection at the Smithsonian was a compliment, indeed. Pi Phi standards are high and consequently rewarding. Hotel Arrowcraft Shop Elizabeth Rue, Iowa Gamma, continues as manager of the Mountain View Hotel Shop. Being semi-retired, she has developed many outside interests in the community and church. Health Center Our Jennie Nicol Health Center perhaps witnessed the greatest change Nurse Marjorie Chalmers having retired after twenty-seven years at Settlement School. In November Brenda Allison, R.N., from the University of Tennessee, accepted the challenge as replacement for much seniority. Brenda has done that very capably the key to success perhaps being a youthful viewpoint. Funds for a much-needed County Hospital are ap THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI 33 proved. Approximately fifty beds will be a radical change from the six-bed clinic of a local physician in Gatlinburg. The hospital will be near the County seat approximately twelve miles from Gatlinburg. Gatlinburg School 1963 doubtless will be remembered as a year of many changes. Five miles east a new high school is scheduled for occupancy in late August. In 1937 the first four-year class graduated from Pi Beta Phi High School (the only Gatlinburg School). The high school annual The .Mountaineer with pictures of Pi Beta Phi High School appropriately had this caption: "For much longer than any of us can remember, these bells have regulated the days, where countless students have worked and worried and laughed and played and searched for knowledge." Over six hundred graduates have passed through the Pi Beta Phi Halls of Ivy. With the consolidation of nearby Pitman Center the new school will be known as Gatlinburg-Pitman High School. Pi Beta Phi will keep its name at the elementary school (grades 1-8) in Gatlinburg, and the Settlement School which includes thirteen buildings and over seventy acres of land. Emily Burchfiel Kile, a University of Tennessee graduate, taught Art and Crafts for Pi Phi during 1962-1963. Mary Ruth Smith, having acquired her Master's degree at the University of Tennessee is scheduled to teach Art and Crafts in 1963-1964. At this writing there is no replacement for Glenn Terry who developed an excellent music program last year. It was decided to discontinue the wood-working classes with the removal of the high school. The Dormitory Fifteen to twenty boys and girls were "living in" throughout the year. A few were eventually dropouts from school, hence from the dormitory. One of the cases was an eighth grade boy who was seventeen years old. Deplorable, indeed! Because he is a future citizen who will be rearing a family someday and voting in our democratic government. . . . There was a goodly number of honors to balance the score. These various honors captain of foot-ball, members of Student Council, parts in class plays, class officers perhaps are the only tangible evidence of accomplishments. However, those of us who work with the children literally "see" growth not only physically, but in character and personality. At graduation it was truly thrilling for a three-year dormitory boy to receive the award for the best all-round boy as chosen by the faculty; also for a freshman dormitory boy to receive the award (also as chosen by the faculty) for the most improvement. A four-year dormitory girl received the award for showing the best sportsmanship in basketball. Living in the dormitory is broadening experience for the students. It's character building to "keep hours" and assume responsibilities in addition to their school work. Our slogan is to be a good student first, then find time for other activities. (Needless to say, all do not attain their goal.) Ruth Spelman, a Golden Arrow Pi Phi from Illinois Epsilon, serves as housemother for the girls. The Red Barn The Red Barn continues to be popular with religious, philanthropic, and educational groups for retreats and workshops. The Owls' Nest and Little Pigeon Loft prove to be an attraction. Personnel All personnel is the same except for new staff rnembers mentioned previously. With the thirteen buildings and over seventy acres there is an endless amount of maintenance. Orlie Watson for over thirty-seven years with Settlement School is always ready for emergencies (and somehow, they have a way of coming at night). Neal, Zanley, and Richard Watson "don't even have time for fishing." It is a rare day that something doesn't have to be "fixed." The winter weather was most unusual, the coldest ever, with ten days of school missed (the time had to be made up before the end of the semester). In cold weather there is always much "busyness" preventing trouble. Gateway Theatre On this tour of the school grounds during the summer one notes a sign at the school building, saying "Gateway Theatre." John Richards has directed a young group of theatrical students from the American Academy of Drama in New York for seventeen summers. His repertoire of four or five plays is given in the school auditorium. Little Pigeon Alumni Club This Alumnae Club is fortunate to have approximately fourteen Pi Phis in the vicinity, hence has developed an increasing interest and loyalty to Settlement School. Evidence of this was the Evelyn Bishop Lounge in the Loom House which was dedicated in July 1962. This room was furnished with the Memorial Fund to which many local citizens as well as Pi Phis everywhere honored the first head resident of Settlement School. Lest We Forget Our Memorial to our Pi Beta Phi Founders is some-thing of which every Pi Beta Phi should be proud. By keeping alive the best of the past, it helps us tc build the future. Let us light TOMORROW with TODAY ! Respectfully submitted, MARION W. MUELLER, Director Accountants' Report Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Committee, Pi Beta Phi Settlement School, Gatlinburg, Tennessee. We have examined the balance sheet of Pi Beta Ph Settlement School as of May 31, 1963, and the relatec statements of income and expenses and fund balances fol the year then ended. Our examination was made in ac cordance with generally accepted auditing standards and except that we did not observe the procedures employec in ascertaining inventory quantities or make tests of the valuation thereof, it included such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures as we consid ered necessary in the circumstances. As the scope of our examination did not include ob servance of the inventory-taking or tests of the inventor] quantities or valuation thereof, and as we were unable t( satisfy ourselves by other means as to the amount at -whict the inventory is stated, we are not in a position to ex press an opinion upon the financial statements. However otherwise than as affected by the foregoing exception, i is our opinion that the statements have been prepared 1'1 accordance with generally accepted accounting principle applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding year.

We promptly put them all to work, and they responded beautifully. On the recommendation of our architect, Mr. James M. Battersby, AIA, of Knoxville, Illinois, we had (1) four round steel columns put in the northwest corner of the basement to shore up the beams and joists; (2) the floors on the first floor levelled and refinished; and (3) the east exterior wall brushed and repainted where the paint was peeling. Mrs. Hines, our hostess at Holt House, reports the refinished floors look lovely. We had sad news in the fact that we lost four trees to the dutch elm disease last summer. They have been removed, but will also have to be replaced. The kitchen cabinets have new hardware, which is the first since the original restoration. A Holt House sign has been placed on Broadway, the main street in Monmouth, thanks to the efforts of Cleone Barnes Rawson, the Monmouth member of our committee. We have had complaints about the lack of such a sign for many years, and are grateful for her work in securing per-mission to have one. At the fall meeting of the Holt House committee we hired Mrs. Ada Willer-Peterson, AID, of Chicago to help with the long range planning and redecorating of Holt House. We hope to repaper the dining room and Pine room this summer, and put up new curtains in both rooms. The decorator has sent sample boxes to the committee, from which they are to make their selection. Next year we hope to do the parlor and hall. Our aim is to have Holt House in A-1 condition by the Centennial in 1967. From May 1, 1962 to April 30, 1963 Holt House was used 128 times, 17 of them by Pi Phis. We have purposely kept the rentals low so more clubs and individuals would feel they could use it. In this way we feel it is helping to serve the purpose to which our Founders aspired. Many clubs use it as a regular meeting place, and we have had several wedding receptions this year. Forty-seven chapters and clubs have used the slides for programs this year, This is a record! If you haven't seen them, try to schedule them this fall. They are most interesting and informative, and a script accompanies them. Send your requests in early to Miss Margaret Dick, 288 Southmoreland, Decatur, Illinois. Pi Province North sent us 5 green stamp books, and with them plus some others we had, we were able to purchase a copper kitchen clock, and a large coffee maker. The latter delighted all the clubs, because they formerly had to furnish their own. Marion Keck Simmons sent four books which are quite an addition to our library. A 100% record of contributions last year from the active chapters was a first. Only 8 alumni clubs refrained from donating. We hope we will have 100% from both this year. Your contributions are necessary to keep Holt House in tip top shape. For those of you who have never visited Holt House, I hope someday you may. It is lovely, and the ideals it symbolizes are worth everything we can do to keep them going.

SHIRLEY JONES MANN Accountants' Report Holt House Committee, Pi Beta Phi, Galesburg, Illinois. We have examined the accompanying statement of fund balance of the Holt House Treasurer Pi Beta Phi, resulting from recorded cash transactions, for the year ended May 31, 1963. Our examination was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records, and such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. In our opinion, the accompanying statement presents fairly the fund balance of the Holt House Treasurer Pi Beta Phi at May 31, 1963, resulting from recorded cash transactions, and the receipts collected and expenses disbursed during the year then ended, on a basis consistent with that of the preceding year.
