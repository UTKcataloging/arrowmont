        Kentucky Beta's New Home by Ann Pladles, The Kentucky Beta Chapter has recently moved into a new house. Located at the University of Kentucky, Pi Beta Phi has been on this campus for only five years, but from its start, a new house has been the dream of every member. Last fall the dream was realized and became our home. The outside of the house gives an appearance of grandeur, for it is a large, square brick house with a traditional colonial entrance. There is a sizeable front lawn with a cement walk leading to the door. Inside, the large entrance hall, usually filled with busy girls, reflects the warmth of the entire house. Many times this hall has been used to welcome serenading fraternity men or rushees. This hall is the place where the social aspects of Pi Phi college life begin and end. The living room is big, but at the same time comfortable and friendly. It is furnished in Eighteenth Century reproductions, and you almost al-ways see people sitting on the couches talking or someone playing the piano. It is the center of activity as well as a gathering place where everyone meets before a chapter function. Hibiscus is the main color of the room and adds to its warmth as does the fireplace. The walls, woodwork, and draperies are the color of rice cloth providing a contrast with the hibiscus. There is a large dining room which seats about fifty girls, and at mealtime, singing can usually be heard as an after dinner relaxation. An enclosed carpeted stairway from the main hall leads to the girls' rooms upstairs. Forty-four girls live on two floors in two and four girl rooms, each with a different color theme. The rooms reflect the personalities of the girls living in them and are all decorated differently. On the first floor of bedrooms there is also a lounge that can be used as an extra meeting room, for guests, for television, for playing bridge, and various other leisure time activities. Anything from study halls to parties are held in the all-purpose room in the basement. And some-times music can be heard during a jam session. This is where meetings are held and many other chapter functions. The basement is not yet finished and we hope to have it wood panelled. Kentucky Beta Chapter House Kentucky Beta There is much yet to be done, however, for our new home, and the Kentucky Beta's along with their Alumnre Club are getting it done. We are keeping up a shutter fund to eventually get the thirty-seven pairs of shutters for the outside of the house. The Mothers' Club has contributed greatly to the landscaping. Realizing this dream of a new house took hard work, elimination, and give and take. It took an en-tire summer of negotiation just to get the lot, an-other to decide on an architect, and another year for plans. Then, it was one year more to build the house. But we got the three things we were promised at the beginning of it all a roof instead of a flat-topped building, closet doors (some sorority houses had to eliminate these), and a staircase in the entrance hall so that when a girl got married she could throw her bridal bouquet from it. Indiana Delta House Gets Three Story Wing Indiana Delta Pi Phis have enjoyed the comfort of more space and convenience of several new features since January of this year when a $280,000 three story wing on their house on the Purdue University Campus was completed. The journal and Courier, Layfayette daily paper, noted that this wing gave the Pi Phis the distinction of being the first sorority house on campus to have a houseboy's room. It gained that and much more in the well planned and executed building expansion. The wing, added to the rear of the original house is in Georgian architecture that matches the original design. It was made possible by the purchase of an adjacent lot and this also made thirty-five more parking spaces available. The new wing includes a dining room, kitchen, and commissary on the first floor; eleven study rooms on the second floor and six study rooms and a large dormitory on the third floor. In case of power failure, the latter area is equipped with standby automatic lighting. Included in the new basement is the houseboy's room, laundry and storage areas and a new furnace. The building project included extensive remodeling of the present house to provide new telephone, mail and coat centers near the entrance foyer, where there is also a powder room for guests. A kitchenette was made available for the use of members and the entire house redecorated. In addition to Layfayette alumnae who worked on the building program, there were an estimated 45 alumnae across the country who served as area chair-men in fund-raising activities. News from Little Pigeon Edited by Sally Wild Gordon, Wisconsin A At Settlement School. , ... Our roots are deep in craft programs ... Since the beginning of Arrowcraft in 1925 we have been conscious of the value of crafts. Arrowcraft was one of the earliest cottage industries and is a project of which all Pi Phis should be proud. A Many Faceted Program Emil Jensen of Lake Worth, Florida, and Jo Hansen of Fort Worth, Texas, work in a 1965 Summer Craft Workshop jewelry class. Jo is a Texas Gamma Pi Phi and was an assistant in 1965. The Craft Workshop program is a many faceted program that appeals to all ages and offers preparation in a wide variety of fields. Welcome, Delegates The Settlement School Committee will be at Convention to offer any assistance possible, so please feel free to call upon them at any time. Dorothy Thorman, Illinois Epsilon, of Winnetka, Illinois (North Shore Alumnae Club) is chair-man of the committee. Sally Bosman Schneiter, Indiana Gamma, of Muncie, Indiana (Muncie Alumnae Club) is our hard working treasurer. Eloise Glazner Hensley, Oklahoma Beta, of Kemah, Texas (Houston Alumnae Club) keeps the minutes and sends out the publicity. Edith Hoyer Rankin, Ohio Beta, of Columbus, Ohio (Columbus Alumni Club) keeps you sup-plied with the slides and movie films. Sally Wild Gordon, Wisconsin Alpha, of Pasadena, California (Pasadena Alumnae Club) keeps you up to date with the Settlement School through the News from Little Pigeon. High Praise For Settlement School Program by Trish Crowley, New Mexico Alpha As one of the three Pi Phis selected as graduate assistants for the 1965 Craft Workshop, I know that I speak for the other two in my high praise for the entire Settlement School program. What a meaningful experience to participate in what had previously been nothing more to me than rather abstract reports from the Settlement School Commit-tee. The school is staffed by a wonderful group of Pi Phi Alumni. It was certainly my pleasure to work with one of the finest Pi Phis I have known, Mrs. Maria Tate, Manager of the Arrowcraft Shop, while giving Arrowcraft a somewhat new and mod-ern look. We both worked every evening until after eleven and never did Mrs. Tate complain of the late hour or the fact that she had been working at Arrowcraft since eight that morning. The window of the hanging handwoven purses increased the sales Trish Crowley in the Evelyn Bishop Lounge at the Loom House. to almost a sell-out. With proposed plans the Arrowcraft Shop will certainly be the most striking and unique shop of the main street. Pi Phi Craft Workshop was for me a wonderful creative opportunity. With the well supplied labs, excellent instruction, and the beauty of the Smoky Mountains for design inspiration, even the beginner in any of the crafts areas will find Gatlinburg a re-warding and exciting experience. The graduate credit offered through the University of Tennessee was applied to the graduate work that I am currently doing at the University of New Mexico. My most recent work has been on exhibit at the Southwest Ecclesiastical Show, The World's Fair, the University of New Mexico, The Designer-Craftsmen of New Mexico and in Gatlinburg. Examples of my weaving were included in the "Stichery, Lace and Loom" show in Bloomfield, Michigan in January and February of 1966. Away from the complexities and daily routine, the Craft Workshop offered an atmosphere of friendliness, including personal touches of daily fresh flowers, Southern cooking specialties and tours of local craftsmen's shops. A delight was the vegetable dyeing course, using age-old methods and common flowers to produce colors unattainable with modern dyes. Who could imagine the delicate color achieved with the Queen Anne's Lace. But the beauty from the simple Marigold surpasses all in its depth of brilliant golds and oranges. Speaking as a recipient of this fine opportunity to research unexplored areas of Americana I feel that the Fraternity should be commended for its excel-lent forward thinking in this meaningful experience. A Dream Fulfilled by Frank E. Dean Over the past thirty years, my wife and I spent our spring and fall vacations in Gatlinburg, following with great interest the wonderful work Pi Phi has done, and is doing in stimulating and developing the handicrafts. I, personally, spent count-less hours watching and admiring potters at their wheels, wishing I had the time to try my hand. Fate intervened and at the age of fifty-three I was forced into early retirement due to a cardiac condition, after having spent thirty-three years working with a major oil company. Now at long last I did have the time, but could I do it and where could I get instructions? We had made many friends during our stays in Gatlinburg and after repeated invitations and urging from Mrs. Elizabeth Rue, Ken and Barbara MacDonald and others, I sent in my application for the pottery courses of the 1965 Craft Workshop. I have never spent a more profitable and enjoyable time not only for the "pots" I have made and will make, but I find it a grand therapy to be able to go into my workshop, grab a ball of clay, spin the wheel and forget the cares of the world. So, the age-old adage, "Every Cloud has a Silver Lining," has never proven more true for me than when forced into retirement, I turned to my favorite hobby of Flower Arranging, affiliating with a florist, to occupy my time and supplement my greatly reduced income. To be able to make pottery for myself and to find homes for it carrying my flower arrangements, is indeed a wonderful satisfaction. I feel deeply indebted to Pi Phi for making it possible for me to gain a working knowledge of handicrafts and words cannot express my appreciation and praise of the excellent staff. I am anxiously looking forward to the 1966 Craft Workshop my only regrets that I did not find the time to take advantage of this golden opportunity years ago. Frank Dean shapes clay. Cathy Russell (top) instructs a Craft Workshop student in pottery. Albuquerque Scholarship Winner Cathy Russell, the 1965 winner of the Albuquerque, New Mexico scholarship to the Craft Work-shop, has been an art teacher in Alaska and now in New Mexico for the Board of National Missions of the United Presbyterian Church USA. The Church has provided schools in those areas where schools were needed. However, when the State or Federal Government is ready to provide adequate schools in those areas the Board withdraws the mission stations. In the mission school in Sitka, Alaska there were many Eskimos, as well as Aleut and Athepaskan (a northern interior Indian) and several Anglo students from logging camps. In New Mexico it is the Spanish American with the greatest education need. A small tuition is charged those who can pay and each student is required to participate in some aspect of the work program. As Cathy writes: "Needless to say, my excellent instructors and the many rich experiences at Gatlin-burg this past summer have been invaluable to my own instructing this year. The ceramics which my students have produced show both a respect for the clay, as well as a creative experimenting with the media. I hope to have at least two students work on the one table loom. As weaving is not taught at the University of New Mexico, where I have been taking graduate work, the fine instruction I received in weaving at the Craft Workshop further points out the reason this last summer was so important to me. A Day o Re mber by Louise Kelch on vier, Indiana Alpha It all began in the summer of 1965, Indiana's own First Lady, Josephine Mardis Branigin (Mrs. Roger D.) an Indiana Alpha, graciously offered the use of the Governor's Mansion to the Franklin and Indianapolis Alumnae Clubs for a Pi Phi project of their choosing. This was a natural for an Arrowcraft Tea and Display. Virginia Brackett Green, a former chair-man of the Settlement School Committee and experienced in the ways of teas and Arrowcraft lore, agreed to be the general chairman. Committees from our two clubs began thinking in terms of a thousand guests, but only in a whisper, lest we alarm our hostess. It was then that our thoughts ran thus if, happily, our many guests arrived, must we not have a great variety of Arrowcraft to show and sell? So Virginia, always ready to go that extra mile for Pi Phi, drove the Arrowcraft chairman several hundred miles to Gatlinburg. There, aided and encouraged by Maria Tate and Marion Mueller, hundred of articles were selected, from the lowliest pot holder to the brightest afghan, from a tiny cop-per ashtray to a long cabin broom. Meetings were held to get ready for the big event on October 27th. Promptly at eleven-thirty on a perfect Pi Phi day guests began coming and never stopped until our hostess closed the doors at four-thirty. Tea, coffee and homemade delicacies were served in the beautiful dining room. Guests visited, had tea, looked and bought, to such an extent that soon we were wishing we had more to show and sell. It was truly a success outstanding sales was one sign but if one wished to look for other values, they were there too, the "intangibles" the image of Pi Phi that this occasion presented to the public, the opportunity for Pi Phis to work together, the chance to show the success of our own Settlement School. Good Arrowcraft Year Arrowcraft has had its biggest year since 1962. Weavers have been working at top speed. Our appreciation and thanks to all those loyal clubs both large and small who had such out-standing Arrowcraft sales. But our apologies for our inability to fill all your special orders for Christmas. It was not only embarrassing to you, but also to us at Arrowcraft. Please keep up your good work. Remember that the weavers can only do so much, so order as early as possible, anticipating your future needs. We want to be better prepared to supply you with merchandise you need. Attention Canadian Pi is A questionnaire has gone out to all Canadian Alumnae Clubs and Chapters asking for an evaluation of the Canadian Project. If you, as an individual Pi Phi, have any concrete suggestions to offer please let your executive know, or write directly to the Chairman of the Canadian Project, Mrs. J. M. Traill, 1736 West 68th Ave., Vancouver 14, B.C. California Alpha Scholarships For those who might not know, the California Alpha chapter has been perpetuated by the California Alpha scholarship fund. When the house was sold to Stanford, the money was put into trust with national. From the interest earned on this money, three $340 scholarships a year are given to incoming senior class members in Pi Beta Phi chapters. These scholarships are awarded on the basis of need, fraternity service and loyalty, school activity participation, scholastic record, and future plans for the use of education. Usually the recipient would be forced to drop out of school her senior year if not helped financially. STUDYING ABROAD-Illinois Beta-Delta chapter is fortunate to have one of its members, Janet Sanford, chosen to study abroad in France in the spring semester. She is attending the University of Poitiers, in Poitiers, France, through the Syracuse University program which is open to only twenty students in the United States. Some of her campus activities include membership in French Club and the Board of Public Relations. Janet was also the recipient of the Lorraine Smith Prize in French her sophomore year. She plans to return to Knox her senior year to complete her studies as a French and Russian language major. 14 New Honor for Carolyn Kovener of Iowa Alpha by Miriam Thrall Erickson, Ohio Zeta Carolyn Ottinger Kovener, past-president of the Minneapolis Pi Beta Phi Alumnae Club, has been selected to appear in the 1965 edition of Outstanding Young Women of America, on the basis of her achievements and contribution to her family, community, state and nation. Carolyn was nominated for this honor by Iowa Wesleyan College, where she is re-membered as being a campus leader, having served as Stu-dent Union President among other activities. Since graduation she has continued to sup-port the college, particularly helping the alumnae office to keep in touch with other alumnae. The daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Q. A. Ottinger of Park Ridge, Illinois, Carolyn now lives in Wayzata, Minnesota. She is married to Ronald R. Kovener, Controller of the American Rehabilitation Foundation in Minneapolis. With their two-year-old daughter, Martha, the Koveners enjoy living in a 65 year-old home fronting on Lake Minnetonka. A Home Economics major, Carolyn has worked since graduation for Marshall Field Company and Kraft Foods Company in Chicago, and the Pillsbury Company in Minneapolis. At Pillsbury she has helped with the Grand National Bake-Off. She has also done recipe development and testing for several cookbooks, including books for Pillsbury and Kraft. Members of the Minneapolis Alumnae Club are particularly conscious of Carolyn's friendly smile and complete dedication to whatever task is at hand. Her loyalty to Pi Phi has been constant. In Park Ridge she chartered an alumnae club in 1955. She is presently President of the Twin-Cities Panhellenic Society, having just finished a term as Vice-President. In her busy schedule she finds time to do volunteer work at Kenny Rehabilitation Institute in physical therapy. A Member of Jr. Wamso (Women's Association for the Minneapolis Symphony Organization) she is also a member of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and Walker Art Gallery. Sunday mornings find her helping in the crib room at Wayzata (Congregational) Community Church. A Pi is Service To Others by Elaine Brodas, Pennsylvania Gamma Pennsylvania Epsilon's Joan Bowman is in every sense of the word outstanding. Joan's aim is to "experience as much of college life as possible." She has said, "I want a liberal education with a people-oriented approach." As president of her chapter, Joan was considered the backbone of the chapter. Her common sense and diplomacy have brought her the respect and confidence of the entire chapter. At Penn State her search for a full college life led her to many clubs and organizations. Her interests include Liberal Arts Student Council, Fencing Club, Gymnastics Club, AWS Council, AWS Treasurer and finally as AWS President. In spite of all her activities, Joan has fared well academically. She has all-University average above 3.00 and is a member of Cwens, Chimes, women's hat societies, Alpha Lambda Delta, and Mortar Board, national honorary societies. Joan is spending the spring term, her last as a Penn State student, in Spain in the University's Study Abroad Program. Then she plans to go to drama school in London to become a character ac-tress. Her choice of a career, she says, was dictated by a want "to share what I think is good with other people." The essence of learning, conversation, and service to others, have always been most important to Joan. She is a student who does give of herself in a humble way. Joan's outstanding performance as a per-son, a student and a Pi Phi can be perhaps summed up by her selection to Who's Who in American Colleges and Universities. Joan Bowman Carolyn 5

Joan Bowman Carolyn 5 Kentucky Beta's New Home by Ann Pladles, The Kentucky Beta Chapter has recently moved into a new house. Located at the University of Kentucky, Pi Beta Phi has been on this campus for only five years, but from its start, a new house has been the dream of every member. Last fall the dream was realized and became our home. The outside of the house gives an appearance of grandeur, for it is a large, square brick house with a traditional colonial entrance. There is a sizeable front lawn with a cement walk leading to the door. Inside, the large entrance hall, usually filled with busy girls, reflects the warmth of the entire house. Many times this hall has been used to welcome serenading fraternity men or rushees. This hall is the place where the social aspects of Pi Phi college life begin and end. The living room is big, but at the same time comfortable and friendly. It is furnished in Eighteenth Century reproductions, and you almost al-ways see people sitting on the couches talking or someone playing the piano. It is the center of activity as well as a gathering place where everyone meets before a chapter function. Hibiscus is the main color of the room and adds to its warmth as does the fireplace. The walls, woodwork, and draperies are the color of rice cloth providing a contrast with the hibiscus. There is a large dining room which seats about fifty girls, and at mealtime, singing can usually be heard as an after dinner relaxation. An enclosed carpeted stairway from the main hall leads to the girls' rooms upstairs. Forty-four girls live on two floors in two and four girl rooms, each with a different color theme. The rooms reflect the personalities of the girls living in them and are all decorated differently. On the first floor of bedrooms there is also a lounge that can be used as an extra meeting room, for guests, for television, for playing bridge, and various other leisure time activities. Anything from study halls to parties are held in the all-purpose room in the basement. And some-times music can be heard during a jam session. This is where meetings are held and many other chapter functions. The basement is not yet finished and we hope to have it wood panelled. Kentucky Beta Chapter House Kentucky Beta There is much yet to be done, however, for our new home, and the Kentucky Beta's along with their Alumnre Club are getting it done. We are keeping up a shutter fund to eventually get the thirty-seven pairs of shutters for the outside of the house. The Mothers' Club has contributed greatly to the landscaping. Realizing this dream of a new house took hard work, elimination, and give and take. It took an en-tire summer of negotiation just to get the lot, an-other to decide on an architect, and another year for plans. Then, it was one year more to build the house. But we got the three things we were promised at the beginning of it all a roof instead of a flat-topped building, closet doors (some sorority houses had to eliminate these), and a staircase in the entrance hall so that when a girl got married she could throw her bridal bouquet from it. Indiana Delta House Gets Three Story Wing Indiana Delta Pi Phis have enjoyed the comfort of more space and convenience of several new features since January of this year when a $280,000 three story wing on their house on the Purdue University Campus was completed. The journal and Courier, Layfayette daily paper, noted that this wing gave the Pi Phis the distinction of being the first sorority house on campus to have a houseboy's room. It gained that and much more in the well planned and executed building expansion. The wing, added to the rear of the original house is in Georgian architecture that matches the original design. It was made possible by the purchase of an adjacent lot and this also made thirty-five more parking spaces available. The new wing includes a dining room, kitchen, and commissary on the first floor; eleven study rooms on the second floor and six study rooms and a large dormitory on the third floor. In case of power failure, the latter area is equipped with standby automatic lighting. Included in the new basement is the houseboy's room, laundry and storage areas and a new furnace. The building project included extensive remodeling of the present house to provide new telephone, mail and coat centers near the entrance foyer, where there is also a powder room for guests. A kitchenette was made available for the use of members and the entire house redecorated. In addition to Layfayette alumnae who worked on the building program, there were an estimated 45 alumnae across the country who served as area chair-men in fund-raising activities. News from Little Pigeon Edited by Sally Wild Gordon, Wisconsin A At Settlement School. , ... Our roots are deep in craft programs ... Since the beginning of Arrowcraft in 1925 we have been conscious of the value of crafts. Arrowcraft was one of the earliest cottage industries and is a project of which all Pi Phis should be proud. A Many Faceted Program Emil Jensen of Lake Worth, Florida, and Jo Hansen of Fort Worth, Texas, work in a 1965 Summer Craft Workshop jewelry class. Jo is a Texas Gamma Pi Phi and was an assistant in 1965. The Craft Workshop program is a many faceted program that appeals to all ages and offers preparation in a wide variety of fields. Welcome, Delegates The Settlement School Committee will be at Convention to offer any assistance possible, so please feel free to call upon them at any time. Dorothy Thorman, Illinois Epsilon, of Winnetka, Illinois (North Shore Alumnae Club) is chair-man of the committee. Sally Bosman Schneiter, Indiana Gamma, of Muncie, Indiana (Muncie Alumnae Club) is our hard working treasurer. Eloise Glazner Hensley, Oklahoma Beta, of Kemah, Texas (Houston Alumnae Club) keeps the minutes and sends out the publicity. Edith Hoyer Rankin, Ohio Beta, of Columbus, Ohio (Columbus Alumni Club) keeps you sup-plied with the slides and movie films. Sally Wild Gordon, Wisconsin Alpha, of Pasadena, California (Pasadena Alumnae Club) keeps you up to date with the Settlement School through the News from Little Pigeon. High Praise For Settlement School Program by Trish Crowley, New Mexico Alpha As one of the three Pi Phis selected as graduate assistants for the 1965 Craft Workshop, I know that I speak for the other two in my high praise for the entire Settlement School program. What a meaningful experience to participate in what had previously been nothing more to me than rather abstract reports from the Settlement School Commit-tee. The school is staffed by a wonderful group of Pi Phi Alumni. It was certainly my pleasure to work with one of the finest Pi Phis I have known, Mrs. Maria Tate, Manager of the Arrowcraft Shop, while giving Arrowcraft a somewhat new and mod-ern look. We both worked every evening until after eleven and never did Mrs. Tate complain of the late hour or the fact that she had been working at Arrowcraft since eight that morning. The window of the hanging handwoven purses increased the sales Trish Crowley in the Evelyn Bishop Lounge at the Loom House. to almost a sell-out. With proposed plans the Arrowcraft Shop will certainly be the most striking and unique shop of the main street. Pi Phi Craft Workshop was for me a wonderful creative opportunity. With the well supplied labs, excellent instruction, and the beauty of the Smoky Mountains for design inspiration, even the beginner in any of the crafts areas will find Gatlinburg a re-warding and exciting experience. The graduate credit offered through the University of Tennessee was applied to the graduate work that I am currently doing at the University of New Mexico. My most recent work has been on exhibit at the Southwest Ecclesiastical Show, The World's Fair, the University of New Mexico, The Designer-Craftsmen of New Mexico and in Gatlinburg. Examples of my weaving were included in the "Stichery, Lace and Loom" show in Bloomfield, Michigan in January and February of 1966. Away from the complexities and daily routine, the Craft Workshop offered an atmosphere of friendliness, including personal touches of daily fresh flowers, Southern cooking specialties and tours of local craftsmen's shops. A delight was the vegetable dyeing course, using age-old methods and common flowers to produce colors unattainable with modern dyes. Who could imagine the delicate color achieved with the Queen Anne's Lace. But the beauty from the simple Marigold surpasses all in its depth of brilliant golds and oranges. Speaking as a recipient of this fine opportunity to research unexplored areas of Americana I feel that the Fraternity should be commended for its excel-lent forward thinking in this meaningful experience. A Dream Fulfilled by Frank E. Dean Over the past thirty years, my wife and I spent our spring and fall vacations in Gatlinburg, following with great interest the wonderful work Pi Phi has done, and is doing in stimulating and developing the handicrafts. I, personally, spent count-less hours watching and admiring potters at their wheels, wishing I had the time to try my hand. Fate intervened and at the age of fifty-three I was forced into early retirement due to a cardiac condition, after having spent thirty-three years working with a major oil company. Now at long last I did have the time, but could I do it and where could I get instructions? We had made many friends during our stays in Gatlinburg and after repeated invitations and urging from Mrs. Elizabeth Rue, Ken and Barbara MacDonald and others, I sent in my application for the pottery courses of the 1965 Craft Workshop. I have never spent a more profitable and enjoyable time not only for the "pots" I have made and will make, but I find it a grand therapy to be able to go into my workshop, grab a ball of clay, spin the wheel and forget the cares of the world. So, the age-old adage, "Every Cloud has a Silver Lining," has never proven more true for me than when forced into retirement, I turned to my favorite hobby of Flower Arranging, affiliating with a florist, to occupy my time and supplement my greatly reduced income. To be able to make pottery for myself and to find homes for it carrying my flower arrangements, is indeed a wonderful satisfaction. I feel deeply indebted to Pi Phi for making it possible for me to gain a working knowledge of handicrafts and words cannot express my appreciation and praise of the excellent staff. I am anxiously looking forward to the 1966 Craft Workshop my only regrets that I did not find the time to take advantage of this golden opportunity years ago. Frank Dean shapes clay. Cathy Russell (top) instructs a Craft Workshop student in pottery. Albuquerque Scholarship Winner Cathy Russell, the 1965 winner of the Albuquerque, New Mexico scholarship to the Craft Work-shop, has been an art teacher in Alaska and now in New Mexico for the Board of National Missions of the United Presbyterian Church USA. The Church has provided schools in those areas where schools were needed. However, when the State or Federal Government is ready to provide adequate schools in those areas the Board withdraws the mission stations. In the mission school in Sitka, Alaska there were many Eskimos, as well as Aleut and Athepaskan (a northern interior Indian) and several Anglo students from logging camps. In New Mexico it is the Spanish American with the greatest education need. A small tuition is charged those who can pay and each student is required to participate in some aspect of the work program. As Cathy writes: "Needless to say, my excellent instructors and the many rich experiences at Gatlin-burg this past summer have been invaluable to my own instructing this year. The ceramics which my students have produced show both a respect for the clay, as well as a creative experimenting with the media. I hope to have at least two students work on the one table loom. As weaving is not taught at the University of New Mexico, where I have been taking graduate work, the fine instruction I received in weaving at the Craft Workshop further points out the reason this last summer was so important to me. A Day o Re mber by Louise Kelch on vier, Indiana Alpha It all began in the summer of 1965, Indiana's own First Lady, Josephine Mardis Branigin (Mrs. Roger D.) an Indiana Alpha, graciously offered the use of the Governor's Mansion to the Franklin and Indianapolis Alumnae Clubs for a Pi Phi project of their choosing. This was a natural for an Arrowcraft Tea and Display. Virginia Brackett Green, a former chair-man of the Settlement School Committee and experienced in the ways of teas and Arrowcraft lore, agreed to be the general chairman. Committees from our two clubs began thinking in terms of a thousand guests, but only in a whisper, lest we alarm our hostess. It was then that our thoughts ran thus if, happily, our many guests arrived, must we not have a great variety of Arrowcraft to show and sell? So Virginia, always ready to go that extra mile for Pi Phi, drove the Arrowcraft chairman several hundred miles to Gatlinburg. There, aided and encouraged by Maria Tate and Marion Mueller, hundred of articles were selected, from the lowliest pot holder to the brightest afghan, from a tiny cop-per ashtray to a long cabin broom. Meetings were held to get ready for the big event on October 27th. Promptly at eleven-thirty on a perfect Pi Phi day guests began coming and never stopped until our hostess closed the doors at four-thirty. Tea, coffee and homemade delicacies were served in the beautiful dining room. Guests visited, had tea, looked and bought, to such an extent that soon we were wishing we had more to show and sell. It was truly a success outstanding sales was one sign but if one wished to look for other values, they were there too, the "intangibles" the image of Pi Phi that this occasion presented to the public, the opportunity for Pi Phis to work together, the chance to show the success of our own Settlement School.
