       <dc:description>This scrapbook, which was assembled between 1919 and 1925, is currently housed in the archives of the Pi Beta Phi National Headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri.  The book contains twenty-seven images, and was likely sent to Pi Beta Phi Alumnae Clubs as a means of soliciting material support for the fraternity's Gatlinburg Settlement School. </dc:description>
