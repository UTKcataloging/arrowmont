<dc:description>This scrapbook, which consists of 217 images, was assembled by Pi Beta Phi Settlement School Head Resident Evelyn Bishop between 1919 and 1925.  Many of the images in this book appear to have been taken by Settlement School teacher and Tacoma, Washington native Ruth Sturley, and are duplicates of those seen in the Ruth Sturley Scrapbook.  This book is currently housed in the Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts archives. </dc:description>
