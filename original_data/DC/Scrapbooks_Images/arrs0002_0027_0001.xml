      <dc:title>Pi Beta Phi school bus</dc:title>
      <dc:description>The school bus makes two trips every morning and evening to bring those children who live too far in the mountains for them to walk. It is driven by a mountain boy, 22 years old, who goes to school here himself and is in the first year of high school. The children have learned a new song, borrowed from &quot;I want to go back to Millikin&quot; which they like to sing particularly well because it has something their bus in it. Here are the words: &quot;We all like to go to Pi Phi School, Beneath the Smokies blue, Where all of the kids in the old school bus Are making an awful lot of fuss; We all like to go We all like to go To Pi Phi School.&quot;</dc:description>
