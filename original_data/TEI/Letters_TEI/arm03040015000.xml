                    Dearest family: Wednesday night again &amp; no word from you since last Friday so suppose all is well! Hope for an epistle tomorrow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Monday was a lovely warm day but very windy - After practicing the play Emily &amp; I went with Arlena Maples up 
                    <abbr expan="Roaring Fork Creek">Roaring Fork</abbr> to Lillian Reagan&apos;s - Lillian quit school last week so thought I&apos;d 
                    investigate though Evelyn said she always did before the year was up &amp; had gone longer this term than usual. No one seemed to be home so
                    we sat on the front steps &amp; enjoyed the view of the mountains &amp; the roaring of the creek which is very big &amp; noisy after so 
                    much rain. In about twenty minutes or so Mrs. Reagan appeared with Merle the year old baby. She had been at a neighbor&apos;s &amp; the 
                    rest of the family <pb ref="arm03040015003" seq="03"></pb> were at a &quot;buryin&apos;&quot;. The baby was awfully cute laughed at us all
                    very impartially &amp; seemed to like my green cap especially - Wonder what you would have thought of the house and all. The baby was dressed
                    in dark blue serge gown! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We got home just in time for supper which was a cold one but very good - (my appetite is still fearful &amp; wonderful!) sardines - 
                    cold meat - biscuits - jelly - cake. Yesterday the weather turned to rain again &amp; by the time I got home from school was coming 
                    down in torrents - Emily &amp; I had promised to spend the night with Josie Trentham at the hotel so paddled down there a little after
                    five - (It&apos;s light now until nearly 6:30 - Think of that!) Josie &amp; her <pb ref="arm03040015004" seq="04"></pb> mother look after the 
                    hotel - stock &amp; chickens &amp; put up a stray drummer or two once in awhile. We had a very nice supper - beans - pork - fried
                    potates hot biscuits - <hi1 rend="underscore">honey</hi1> (wonderful!) coffee &amp; cookies - We were in bed a little after eight after
                    sitting around the fireplace I started embroidering Evelyn&apos;s nightgown - Emily played the pianola the room was a bedroom but their
                    <hi1 rend="underscore">living</hi1> <hi1 rend="underscore">room</hi1>!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today it turned &quot;brite and fair&quot; once more so after drilling the play - I dashed up Turkey&apos;s Nest on to Mill Creek &amp;
                    called at Josie Ogle&apos;s - Josie has been out of school with the flu - is in Abby&apos;s room &amp; will be back next week. Her 
                    mother is not up yet. None of us had been near them &amp; thought I better go in awhile. None of the trees are out yet but I saw a huge
                    <hi1 rend="underscore">butterfly</hi1> - poor thing - I wonder where it was in last night&apos;s storm of rain thunder &amp; lightning!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This evening have been studying Ivanhoe - ancient history &amp; correcting history papers! One more week only!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This letter I hope you will consider better than nothing! in spite of its brevity - poor <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">inditing</unclear>
                    etc
                </p>
                <p>
                    Must hie me to bed - 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Loads of love as ever
                </p>
