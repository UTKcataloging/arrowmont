                    Dearest family - It seems a long time since last Wednesday evening when I wrote you and yet only three days &amp; part of another have passed. Gatlinburg
                    tonight as they say is wrapped in a blanket of snow. It was snowing when I woke up this <abbr expan="morning">a.m.</abbr> &amp; has continued without
                    ceasing all day so that there are several inches over Mother Earth. None of us have gone forth except Aunt Lizzie to milk &amp; Emily to tramp. She didn&apos;t
                    go far however as the ground underneath is not frozen &amp; the mud consequently a little worse than usual being concealed by a fa<del>r</del><add place="supralinear">ir</add>
                    white covering &amp; deceitful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Things have gone along in the usual routine the last few days - It has been my week of assembly - we finished the &quot;Merchant of Venice&quot; for which I
                    gave the class of four the exam Friday - Estel Huff failed - but the others did <pb ref="arm03040009003" seq="03"></pb> fairly well considering. We <sic corr="practiced">practised</sic> our 
                    Japanese drill Friday after school &amp; cleaned up things fairly well - neatness &amp; order <del>is</del><add place="supralinear">are</add> not
                    taught here in these homes you know &amp; one has to almost stand over the girls every so often to make them do the sweeping as they should.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had the reading of the &quot;Applachian News&quot; the last half hour &amp; the last looking over of speeches before the debate. The cover of the magazine
                    this time was made of course gray paper in the center of which was a large shield of red &amp; white stripes with the blue field across the top - the printing
                    was in blue &amp; the binding of red string - quite patriotic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One contribution was by Elmer Oakley who told how he earned his first dollar - thusly: A man gave him eight dollars with instructions
                    <pb ref="arm03040009004" seq="04"></pb> to go after two gallons of corn whiskey about 3 1/2 miles away &amp; permission to keep a dollar if he could get the 
                    moonshine for seven dollars - He wound up his story with the words &quot;And it was so!&quot; Other articles were - &quot;If I had Aladdin&apos;s Lamp&quot; - 
                    &quot;A Dog&apos;s Opinion of a Cat&quot; - &quot;Why I go to School&quot; - &quot;A Poem&quot; -(spring &amp; flowers) &quot;Adventure of a Penny&quot;
                    &quot;Amusement for a Rainy Day&quot; - &quot;My First Day in School - &quot; Current Events - Jokes - Questions &amp; Answers - continuation of the 
                    <hi1 rend="underscore">Romance</hi1> which is to be finished in the next number.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The debate regarding the League of Nations was very long - there were seven or eight on a side - The affirmative got the decision I&apos;m glad to say - Tom
                    was first speaker on that side &amp; had worked awfully hard. Some wild things were said - The general sentiment here is against it - After this long
                    argument were several recitations &amp; then the reading of the magazine - each contributor reading his own part. So ended that day. I wrote Charlotte A.
                    <!-- Unsure of last name abbr here --> yesterday urging her to come here for the closing of school &amp; then visiting &amp; seeing the sights of the
                    <abbr expan="Gatlinburg">burg</abbr> for a week afterwards or as long as she wished. I do not think or rather expect to be ready to leave the day school 
                    closes - would rather wind up things &amp; my packing the next week instead of being so awfully rushed. I may change my mind but doubt it - anyway if Charlotte
                    would come I&apos;d be willing to wait a few days for her so we could go on to Washington together. Have written Mrs. Helmich about a place to stay. Well - 
                    Mrs. Huff <pb ref="arm03040009005" seq="05"></pb> came in just after we had gotten through with lunch so we sat around the fireplace &amp; visited. Then she Evelyn &amp;
                    Emily went for a walk - Abbie went upstairs for a nap &amp; after reading a little I followed &amp; had one till supper time. Haven&apos;t napped before for weeks
                    &amp; weeks!! In the evening we sat around read &amp; embroidered - I wrote letters - <del>got one off to Beatrice Butler 
                    <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">Beebe</unclear> finally - Her letter was forwarded to me from home way last December. Her husband is a Captain &amp;
                    she wrote me from Brest France where she had gone very unexpectedly with the little boy from Oregon - Was living in officer&apos;s quarters - a maid did all
                        the work - ate at mess - had a Cadillac sedan at their disposal </del><pb ref="arm03040009006" seq="06"></pb> <del>&amp; expected to be sent to Belgium or Germany. She doesn&apos;t
                        know I&apos;m here so wrote quite a lengthy epistle - also wrote Nellie &amp; Katherine</del> - Aunt Lizzie has been embroidering a baby dress for a grandson - 
                    her first attempt at embroidering - She just loves to do it too &amp; does remarkably well considering her age &amp; poor eyesight - 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It has been so nice today not to have Sunday School or <abbr expan="Baptist Young Person&apos;s Union">B.Y.</abbr> - a real holiday! No one has
                    been here except two of the small boys from Maples at the foot of the lane to get some games - and Mr. Creswell who came over a little while but didn&apos;t
                    stay long - I have done a lot of school work today - corrected my English papers - looked over ancient history &amp; read Ivanhoe, which is the next book
                    I&apos;m going to take up - <pb ref="arm03040009007" seq="07"></pb> with the high school class. I had absolutely forgotten it - and had to read it carefully. The
                    girls have read most of the day &amp; went to bed about seven p.m. We played a game for awhile just before supper - very
                    instructive &amp; interesting about insects birds &amp; animals - questions given which you try to answer - 
                </p>
                <p><del>
                        What do you think of my coming back here next year? Shall I plan to come home from Washington D.C. or borrow some money &amp; go north to New York &amp;
                        then home? Couldn&apos;t one of you or both come east &amp; visit me in Gatlinburg? Am crazy to see you all - everyone of you - but as to Tacoma - somehow
                        don&apos;t seem to care much about seeing it <hi1 rend="underscore">yet</hi1> nor going around &amp; visiting everyone &amp; talking about the school &amp;
                        <abbr expan="Great Smoky Mountains">mts.</abbr> &amp; people as no doubt I&apos;d do &amp; have to do. Do not feel like asking the fraternity to pay my
                        expenses home &amp; back &amp; in fact do not think they <add place="supralinear">would</add> do it - nor <add place="supralinear">
                            can they</add> afford it - Please write &amp; tell me just what you think about things.</del>
                    </p>
                <p><del>
                        Must cease &amp; think of bed as the hands of Aunt Lizzie&apos;s old clock on the fireboard are approaching ten. </del>
                    </p>
                <p><del>
                        Don&apos;t imagine there will be many at school tomorrow - probably just enough to keep us there.</del>
                    </p>
                <p><del>
                        Hope the mail gets up <hi1 rend="underscore">all</hi1> <hi1 rend="underscore">right</hi1> Just oceans of love as ever</del>
