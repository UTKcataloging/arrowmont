                     <del>will ease up a little. I am so glad pa&apos;s cold has left him and hope Virginia is as bright as ever by now. I haven&apos;t 
                         answered Nellie&apos;s nice letter yet.</del>The sickness around here is not so bad &amp; no prospects of our having to close school - but Murphey is
                    closed &amp; others nearby.

                     Harrison and his family are up &amp; around - <abbr expan="Harrison">H.</abbr> started working again Monday - much to Mr. Creswell&apos;s 
                    <sic corr="relief">releif</sic> I imagine for he had to attend <add place="supralinear">to</add> the pumping - the fires - the wood &amp; everything else that

                        the measurements &amp; check - &amp; wrote my acceptance so the die is cast! Also asked them to please tell me whether the skirt is to be
                        <add place="supralinear">of</add> cotton or wool - &amp; whether the collar of the waist is to be high or rolling! Wonder what I&apos;ll do next? I feel
                        it&apos;s rather a wild &amp; perhaps - (no <hi1 rend="underscore">probably</hi1> expensive trip. It is wonderful of course &amp; I just can&apos;t
                        realize that I&apos;m going to see <hi1 rend="underscore">the</hi1> <hi1 rend="underscore">Capitol</hi1>!! I&apos;ve also written again about a

                        to write Mrs. Helmick about a place to stay. Do hope Charlotte A. <!-- Unknown last name --> will come.</del>
                    </p>
                <p>
                    No word came from Blanche so guess she didn&apos;t get the telegram or else couldn&apos;t make it or some such reason. Am sorry too.

                    The weather turned cold last night &amp; in the <abbr expan="afternoon">p.m.</abbr> snow fell but it&apos;s been too cold today for more to flitter
                    down. Monday the twelve girls in the drill with Japanese lanterns practiced after school - then in the evening some of the youngsters in the play came 
                    over to get their parts &amp; hear the play - We sat around the dining <pb ref="arm03040010005" seq="05"></pb> room table &amp; worked away for nearly
                    two hours - then toasted marshmallows a little while - and so ended that day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tuesday after school we tried out the play &amp; I do hope it goes off all right - Then I spent the rest of the <abbr expan="afternoon">p.m.</abbr> &amp;
                    evening getting clippings on the League of Nations &amp; <del>for</del> general information on things in school. It&apos;s 
                    surprising what loads of stuff I find - some of the monitors are all cut up. You know I have them way back into July &amp; when I want information for the 
                    debates I go through them. They are all stacked neatly according to months on my little book case The index of contents is a great help &amp; time 
                    saver. <pb ref="arm03040010006" seq="06"></pb>

                <p>
                    Well tonight after school one thing &amp; another came up as I was late getting home as usual - The girls have an awful spell of embroidering &amp; sit
                    around the fire doing it much of the time. Our wood has been low so that we have hugged the fireplace much of the time. I have four classes in the 
                    morning around the big fireplace in the hall whenever it&apos;s cold. It seems quite natural now to do things that way.
                </p>
                <p><del>
                        As to underwear Jane - I really do not need the union suits for awhile - now that I&apos;ve mended them they are quite respectable. As to chemises
                        you have quite enough to do without thinking of them. I&apos;ll manage them</del>
                    </p>
                <p><del>
                        Did I tell you that I had a very nice note from Mrs. Soule? Hope to write Mr. <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">Suell</unclear>
                        again.</del>
                    </p>
                <p>
                    Well I had a little walk tonight looking for butter. Went up to Mrs. Nan Ogle&apos;s - she often sells it - lives on <abbr expan="Baskins Creek">Baskin&apos;s</abbr>
                    above the Huff<del>&apos;</del>s - you go up Pi Phi Lane then across a field &amp; past Harrison&apos;s &amp; so to the creek - such mud!
                    All the rubber one sees worn around here - strap around the ankles. Mrs. Ogle didn&apos;t have any so I went on down the road to Charlie&apos;s where I paid for
                    my telegram &amp; then over to the other store - Calvin Ogle&apos;s - where I got two pounds - each a pat - carried them home in big pasteboard box! Well - it&apos;s
                    8:30 &amp; I&apos;m going to bid you all a fond goodnight &amp; go to bed - Aren&apos;t you surprised - 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ever so much of love
