                <p>
                     Dearest family - This is a dark &amp; very rainy Friday afternoon - &amp; I&apos;m sitting by the window in the living room where I have a view of the muddy
                    road &amp; drowned appearance everywhere outside. Aunt Lizzie is somewhere in the house while down below in the basement wood is being chopped - That
                    &amp; the drip outside &amp; the ticking of Aunt Lizzie&apos;s clock on the fireboard are the only sounds to be heard - Evelyn &amp; Emily having gone for
                    a walk down the road!
                </p>
                <p>
                     Since my last epistle of Monday night nothing of particular note has happened.
                </p>
                <p>
                     Monday evening - My good intentions of Friday failed you see &amp; yesterday spent most of the time calling &amp; then decided that if I waited till tonight
                    I&apos;d have your letter to comment on but <hi1 rend="underscore">alas</hi1> none came - except a very nice one from Lida - Only two or three 
                    times have I <pb ref="arm03040002003" seq="03"></pb> failed to hear from home on Monday during the whole time of my stay - Suppose it was held up 
                    somewhere along the line - as occasionally will happen.
                </p>
                <p>
                     As I was commenting when I ceased Friday - there has seemed to be little to write - about the past two weeks - Emily said the same yesterday - no excitement in
                    particular - or perhaps after the <sic corr="gaiety"><hi1 rend="underscore">gaity</hi1></sic> of New Orleans (or is it <sic corr="gaiety"><hi1 rend="underscore">gayety
                    </hi1></sic>) the mountains seem very quiet.
                </p>
                <p>
                     Well going back over the happenings of the past week - Tuesday after a late session at school. I went  for a walk with Stella &amp; little Blanche Huff after a call there.
                    In the evening Tom came for help with Latin &amp; history. He is a great boy and an exceedingly nice one - fine <pb ref="arm03040002004" seq="04"></pb> sisters - all in our 
                    school but the youngest and she is coming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wednesday Emma Maples and I tramped over the muddy road - getting back about dark - Emma had supper with us - &amp; eventually stayed all night - She is such
                    a dear girl - about eighteen. Told me that the Pi Phis had certainly done a lot for Gatlinburg &amp; that the school just meant everything to her. She loves music so
                    Evelyn played &amp; sang most of the evening - We all helped  more or less - I corrected two sets of history papers on the side meanwhile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thursday after school - help the various debaters with their subject of immigration - practice with the quartet - &amp; finish showing them how to put together our
                    school magazine. Then coming home I started up Pi Phi lane branching off to the little house where Harrison lives &amp; finding him doing up the dishes &amp;
                    looking after the youngsters of which there are three. Two room cabin as usual - but such a nice big stone fireplace &amp; grand fire - You find them in every house - 
                    no wonder they get in the habit of &quot;settin&apos;&quot; Well I set awhile although the lady of the house was not home being on a visit at her
                    <del>mother&apos;s</del> father&apos;s - I did not know she was gone however. He told me about capturing a still up in the Sugar Lands during
                    vacation - From here I journeyed on up <abbr expan="Baskins Creek">Baskins</abbr> to Martha&apos;s &amp; sat in the dusk over another big fire - She - her sister
                    and old mother live <pb ref="arm03040002005" seq="05"></pb> in a two room cabin. She has three little girls - all in school - does our washing you know. Had an awfully good
                    time &amp; stayed so long it was dark when I got home.
                </p>
                <p>
                     Friday after school I just didn&apos;t seem to have the energy to write or do much of anything &amp; wound up by putting on a clean dress after a bath.
                </p>
                <p>
                     Dr. Massy blew in just as we had finished supper - and later Mr. Huff. They visited around the fire until about nine - <del>they</del> then Mr.
                    <abbr expan="Huff">H.</abbr> took the <abbr expan="Dr. Massy">doctor</abbr> home with him. They have a good many business dealings 
                    together - lumber - The <abbr expan="Dr. Massy">doctor</abbr> loves to talk and got started on the churches &amp; ministers <pb ref="arm03040002006" seq="06"></pb>
                    in the county. Too many of both altogether he says.
                </p>
                <p>
                     Saturday was a day of labor for us all as usual - &amp; wound up washing my hair which always produces a cold spell and strong wind. The debate came off in the 
                    evening having been postponed from the night before because of the rain - Two of the girls &amp; I were judges - not much of a crowd there as a &quot;sing&quot; was 
                    held <del>up</del><add place="supralinear">at</add> the Forks of the River. Mr. Cresswell - Stella &amp; Amber Ogle (a new boy just started in the 
                    9th grade) were against immigration - Tom - Cora &amp; Betty Russell for it - had helped the latter the most &amp; really felt they did the best anyway - Mr
                    <abbr expan="Cresswell">C.</abbr> made some perfectly wild remarks - Anyway <pb ref="arm03040002007" seq="07"></pb> I put my influence on Tom&apos;s side &amp;
                    they got the decision. Sunday was the usual excitement of Sunday School - (I forgot to say that Evelyn went home with the <abbr expan="Dr. Massy">doctor</abbr>
                    <abbr expan="Saturday">Sat.</abbr> <abbr expan="evening">eve.</abbr> - back in the morning) a &quot;burial&quot; followed Sunday School for which Abbie &amp;
                    I did not stay - Poor Emily had to as no one else was there who could play <add place="supralinear">(piano)</add> It began to snow &amp; was quite cold - just the
                    day for a brisk tramp - so put on my new <hi1 rend="underscore">green</hi1> <hi1 rend="underscore">cap</hi1> &amp; sallied about three miles up Mill Creek to the 
                    Oakley family where I visited about an hour - such a nice family. We enjoyed it very much - (they &amp; I) After dinner here I felt just like starting out again - so got Josie
                    Trentham at the hotel &amp; we went up Roaring Fork branching off to a little creek. I wanted to see Maud Clabo one of my girls who hasn&apos;t come back yet - another
                    walk of about three miles - From here we went on to the Carr family&apos;s house about a quarter of a mile getting home just at dark in time for 
                    <abbr expan="Baptist Young Person&apos;s Union">B.Y.</abbr> After that Aunt Lizzie &amp; I visited over the fire as Emily went to bed early - Today - Cora McCarter &amp;
                    I went up Little Dudley about 2 <abbr expan="miles">mi.</abbr> to see Mattie <abbr expan="McCarter">McC.</abbr> one of my girls who hasn&apos;t come back since 
                    <abbr expan="Christmas">Xmas</abbr> but expects to tomorrow. Just live to go around &amp; visit this way &amp; hope the weather stays clear this week so I can. Will 
                    not wait so long again - With loads of love to you all as ever
                </p>
                <p>
