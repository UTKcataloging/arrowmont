                    Dearest family: The skirt has just come &amp; is <hi1 rend="underscore">perfectly</hi1> <hi1 rend="underscore">lovely</hi1>
                    - am so overcome with it - it is so pretty - Jane and you are simply a dear to do this for me and I shall get even
                    some time I hope. It will not be any trouble to put in the hem - &amp; shall wait until I get to civilization that is
                    Knoxville or Washington D.C. before shortening it - imagine the skirts are movable again as to length - varying in 
                    different places aren&apos;t they?</del>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is 1:30 &amp; am gowned &amp; in my &quot;mud boats&quot; preparatory to a flight of four miles up the river to 
                    Crockil Maples - for the night - am a gay butterfly this week doing society stuff only - Guess I&apos;ll get my
                    <pb ref="arm03040019003" seq="03"></pb> trunk packed between spasms - hope so because it&apos;s to be down to 
                    Calvin Ogle&apos;s store tomorrow - so there will be plenty of time for waiting for a chance team to take it to the 
                    <abbr expan="Pigeon Forge">Forge</abbr>. Have decided to leave here Tuesday morning via Dan &amp; the buggy &amp; take
                    afternoon train from <abbr expan="Sevierville">S</abbr>. to Knoxville - meeting Abby at the depot - Will have to close
                    up my <hi1 rend="underscore">banking</hi1> for thanks to Mabel I am a firm believer now in the check system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Am writing so fast as I&apos;m in a hurry to get started before the rain descends as it looks quite like doing - am 
                    <hi1 rend="underscore">sick</hi1> of rain positively - but maybe it won&apos;t. Fear if I do not scratch this off now 
                    I won&apos;t get it in the mail tomorrow - and do want it to go out. <pb ref="arm03040019004" seq="04"></pb>

                    Well I was charmed as usual to get both your letters <add place="supralinear">Monday</add>
                    &amp; absorb all their contents from gardening - <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">antoug</unclear> - assessing - 
                    cleaning etc. Such a busy family as I belong to you make me think of Heinz - 57 varieties with the multiplicity &amp;
                    kinds of tasks you both indulge in.</del>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wish you could peep into the living room now &amp; cast your eye around - You would behold Aunt Lizzie sitting by the fire
                    picking over wool - Mrs Proffitt is ironing - board is stretched from the other end of the library table to a chair - her 
                    irons are heated at the fireplace - a bed couch adorns the side of the room between the windows - I knew Aunt Lizzie would 
                    get a <hi1 rend="underscore">bed</hi1> in here when Evelyn left - she did it last fall &amp; we had quite a time working it 
                    out without hurting her feelings - a broom also adorns one end of the fireplace - The two of them have been discussing the new
                    styles at Calvin&apos;s store - Well I&apos;m chatting idly &amp; to no purpose - Monday right after breakfast Aunt Lizzie &amp; 
                    I went up to Russell Ogle&apos;s nearly a mile from here - Mrs. <abbr expan="Ogle">O</abbr>. has been sick you know - We 
                    took her some oranges &amp; &quot;light bread&quot; - and found her much better. It was a lovely morning &amp; on our way back 
                    we stopped at another house to visit a sick girl - she too was better &amp; we resumed our journey homeward - Then 
                    <add place="supralinear">as</add> we went along the river road I beheld a young lady &amp; elderly woman approaching - strangers - 
                    They smiled &amp; stopped &amp; I discovered they were the two <pb ref="arm03040019005" seq="05"></pb> who had written Miss Evelyn 
                    about coming - Nell Wheeler &amp; her mother from Indianapolis. Miss <abbr expan="Wheeler">W</abbr>. teaches English in a 
                    high school - and is very sweet &amp; nice. They wanted to get a horse and buggy for the <abbr expan="afternoon">p.m.</abbr> &amp; 
                    asked so I said I&apos;d find out if Harrison were going to use Dan. We had an early dinner &amp; then I went right over to 
                    <abbr expan="Harrison">H</abbr>&apos;s &amp; found them all at dinner - he Lila &amp; the four youngsters - I fooled around - 
                    visited with them took their pictures etc - then started on to the hotel after getting <hi1 rend="underscore">my</hi1> mail - 
                    and enroute stopped at Maple&apos;s &amp; told Emma to come &amp; &quot;knock about&quot; with me all afternoon (They say 
                    &quot;knock about&quot; here for visiting) She said she&apos;d get ready so then I finally got to the hotel &amp; told the 
                        Wheelers they could have the horse &amp; visited <pb ref="arm03040019006" seq="06"></pb> with them - Then we started up to the cottage - 
                    First I stopped at the store to cash a check &amp; get thread &amp; found a number in there whom I know - Mrs. Huff - Betty - 
                    Mrs. Whaley &amp; Mrs. McCarter (Tom&apos;s mother) who asked me to stay all night &amp; am going there Saturday - but more of 
                    that <del>ano</del> anon. Well eventually I got the Wheelers&apos; off &amp; then Emma &amp; I knocked
                    around - going up Roaring Fork &amp; calling at Josie&apos;s &amp; the Parton&apos;s - got back &amp; went over to the old 
                    schoolhouse on the hill &amp; watched the sun set. Had supper of bread &amp; milk &amp; went to bed. Isn&apos;t this 
                    interesting? Yesterday I started right after breakfast to the hotel as I&apos;d promised to go around with the Wheelers&apos; - 
                        It was another <pb ref="arm03040019007" seq="07"></pb> perfect day - and we walked up Roaring Fork - stopping at various places to 
                    take pictures &amp; visit - met some of my youngsters &amp; showed them the pictures I&apos;d take the last of school which were
                    pretty good - Eventually we got to Maud Clabo&apos;s &amp; visited at her grandmothers. They expect to move into their new house 
                    this week - Maud was helping fix the plaster for the &quot;chimley&quot; - 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We got back at noon - I cleaned up &amp; ate - Mr. Cresswell then arrived - then Miss Wheeler - for we were going up 
                    <sic corr="Baskins">Baskin&apos;s</sic> - we visited enroute &amp; took pictures stopped at Lana Ogle&apos;s where I&apos;d 
                    promised to stay all night so had my little bag in case the time was <hi1 rend="underscore">propitious</hi1>. It was &amp; we
                    got Lana &amp; her sister - &amp; went on up to the old schoolhouse &amp; to some falls - Then Miss Wheeler left me at Ogle&apos;s - 
                    I <del>wen</del> had a very nice time visiting with them - was in bed by eight - a whole room to myself 
                    with two double beds - &amp; up by 4:10 - home by 6:30 - Such is life here! Washed &amp; read then Miss <abbr expan="Wheeler">W.</abbr>
                    arrived &amp; we went up to Tom <sic corr="Campbell&apos;">Camel&apos;</sic> - had a nice visit with them &amp; wonderful view 
                    of the <abbr expan="mountains">mts.</abbr> Since then have gotten my dinner - mail - changed dress &amp; am ready 
                    for my next night out - Have written very hastily - but thought this was better than nothing - must hurry on - Am very well 
                    - <hi1 rend="underscore">fat</hi1> &amp; <hi1 rend="underscore">red</hi1> - have had two little colds &amp; hoarse once last fall - 
                    You remember how I got that way before - no cold just lost my voice - So &quot;<hi1 rend="underscore">don&apos;t</hi1>
                    <hi1 rend="underscore">worry</hi1>&quot; - no more smallpox - Ephraim - <add place="right"> the present victim went 
                    fishing the other day - </add> <add place="right">Loads of love to all as ever - Ruth - </add>
