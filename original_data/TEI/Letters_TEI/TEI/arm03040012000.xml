                    Dearest family - <del>Jane&apos;s letter came Monday &amp; pa&apos;s today (<abbr expan="Wednesday">Wed.</abbr>)
                    so feel quite in touch with you again though the news is a week old when it finally arrives - you know - Pa&apos;s job 
                    <hi1 rend="underscore">was</hi1> a surprise and am glad he likes it &amp; has something to do - </del>Since Sunday no special news
                    has happened - The girls are chatting off &amp; on so don&apos;t know what I may or may not write - Evelyn got back from 
                    Sevierville about one today - walking the seven miles from Pigeon Forge - She has to go in &amp; see about her teeth. We were 
                    all so late this morning - Aunt Lizzie said she had been up since six waiting around for us - Abbie &amp; I got down stairs 
                    just as the first bell rang at a quarter to eight - 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <del>As to news in your respective letters - give my regards to Bessie if you ever see her - Katherine&apos;s 
                        letter sounded very much like those I&apos;ve had from her - am glad she </del><pb ref="arm03040012003" seq="03"></pb><del>is so contented &amp; 
                        hope it continues - Are the trees beginning to come out &amp; the flowers or is it still too early?</del> Not a sign of spring here 
                    as yet except the song of frogs when there is a warm evening - Everything is very late this year - <del>Spring 
                        hats seem so far off &amp; out of my <hi1 rend="underscore">ken</hi1>! Did I <hi1 rend="underscore">ever</hi1> <hi1 rend="underscore">make</hi1>
                        <hi1 rend="underscore">one</hi1>?</del>

                <p><del>
                        Think the gray dress could be fixed over very easily - there is so much material in it.</del>

                <p><del>
                        Are either of you or both thinking of coming east &amp; <hi1 rend="underscore">visit</hi1> <hi1 rend="underscore">me</hi1>? 
                        Imagine when I get through the D.A.R. I&apos;ll want to take the train for home - But on the other hand what good will it 
                        do for me to come except the satisfaction of seeing you all - I can&apos;t decide definitely yet what to do - seem to be in

                <p>
                    Tonight after going through the play at school I went up to see Lila - Harrison&apos;s wife - sat by the fire while she chatted 
                    on &amp; on winding up by showing me all her photographs - such funny queer people as some of them picture - I enjoyed the visit 
                    too - Yesterday Emily &amp; I went up to see Hattie Maples - (wife of Charlie Ogle at the store)  who has a new daughter a little 
                    over a week old now - Monday afternoon I walked up Mill Creek to the Oakley&apos;s as Elmer had been staying out of school - the 
                    other boys tease him - He is back now &amp; hope this is the end of that trouble. Such a pathetic family as they are &amp; in 
                    such a dirty house - the mother only able to drag herself around - six children too. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I must stop now &amp; go to bed though it is only a little after eight - have turned ove a new leaf you see &amp; try to retire 
                    <hi1 rend="underscore">early</hi1> But before closing let me tell you that going up to Elmer&apos;s Monday I was bundled up in my 
                    coat &amp; my cap pulled down over my ears - gloves on too &amp; hands in pockets at that - the mud thawed out some that 
                    <abbr expan="afternoon">p.m.</abbr> &amp; was fearful going but was frozen as I came back - Then the next day (yesterday) was so 
                    warm that I wore my sweater unbuttoned - no gloves - low shoes! What do you think of that?
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a miserable letter but this has been a long day &amp; full of troubles at school so haven&apos;t much 
                    <hi1 rend="underscore">pep</hi1> - though the troubles were not serious &amp; just things that come up every so 
                    often - 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Loads of love to all
                </p>
                <p>
