                    Dearest family - My pen is upstairs &amp; I am <hi1 rend="underscore">too</hi1> <hi1 rend="underscore">lazy</hi1> to make a special trip after it - so please 
                    excuse this pencil which fortunately for me I found in the table drawers - though unfortunately for you isn&apos;t it? It is Sunday night again after a lovely day 
                    - warm &amp; sunny for a wonder - though the weather prophets around here predict rain for tomorrow. <del>I was so pleased &amp; 
                        surprised to get your long letter Friday - Jane - &amp; thank you for it - the stamps &amp; veil inclusive - Yes I remember 
                        Mrs. <unclear reason="illegible" resp="tal">Guernsey</unclear> very well! What are the Band &amp; <unclear reason="illegible" resp="tal">Tillelows</unclear> 
                        <unclear reason="illegible" resp="tal">propo</unclear> </del><pb ref="arm03040014003" seq="03"></pb><del>is very exciting - saw a picture of one in the Digest. I think &amp; 
                        was quite pleased to be able to tell these easterners that we were going to use them! The west is looked down upon somewhat you know - this side of the 
                        Mississippi! No have not written Uncle Art yet about going to <abbr expan="Washington">Wash.</abbr> have not answered the very nice letter he wrote 
                        that I forwarded to you. As to New York well - I have no definite plans for after my D. A. R. <hi1 rend="underscore">ing</hi1>! and shall wait &amp; see how things 
                        work out - have not decided definitely about coming here again. You know - Jane haven&apos;t you enough to do without working 
                        </del><pb ref="arm03040014004" seq="04" n="02"></pb><del>about the new house in the block - Is it square &amp; like the others? How is Louise next door? That reminds me - 
                        What has become of Louise <unclear reason="illegible" resp="tal">Nachstheim</unclear>? I believe I went off without ever saying a word to her didn&apos;t I?</del>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since writing you Wednesday night have put in a busy time - Thursday <abbr expan="evening">eve</abbr> - Abby &amp; I went over to Huff&apos;s for 
                    dinner &amp; the <del>evening</del> <add place="supralinear">night</add> &amp; had an awfully good time. Mr. <abbr expan="Huff">H.</abbr> 
                    is cutting timber towards Pigeon <pb ref="arm03040014005" seq="05"></pb>Forge - has a job that will last a couple of years I guess -
                </p>
                <p>
                    Such a storm of rain &amp; wind as sprung up that night! The worst yet with thunder &amp; lightning thrown in early in the morning - It tried to clear Friday 
                    but didn&apos;t succeed entirely but the debate came off in the evening just the same. Did I tell you the subject. Resolved that fire is more destructive than water. 
                    Such a useless thing but Mr. <abbr expan="Cresswell&apos;s">C&apos;s</abbr> choice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of the youngsters in my room &amp; Abbie&apos;s have been practicing faithfully every day on a dramatization of &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; 
                    they did all the planning &amp; drilling themselves &amp; very well have they done too. They gave it <pb ref="arm03040014006" seq="06"></pb>before the debate - I 
                    helped them dress - using some of our stuff from previous performances -
                </p>
                <p>
                    Saturday it dribbled snow all day without really stopping once but in such a half hearted way that it was practically all gone this morning - I worked at various 
                    things all day - mended &amp; cleaned my wool dresses - darned in the evening - read some of my literature &amp; spent a busy &amp; peaceful day 
                    generally - We had planned to walk over to Tom&apos;s in the <abbr expan="afternoon">p.m.</abbr> &amp; stay all night but went instead this 
                    <abbr expan="morning">a.m.</abbr> starting about Sunday School time - had a great tramp through muddy roads - climbed a hollow went along a ridge 
                    &amp; finally came down through a plowed field &amp; the mud we picked up on our feet! Great cakes! Tom &amp; the girls stay in a little cabin not far from 
                    here for school &amp; go home weekends - they are all such nice youngsters - so much to them &amp; so dependable. Polly helped her mother get dinner 
                    while Tom &amp; the youngest girl Dessie (about six) entertained us - Cora - Clarissy &amp; Birthana came into the burg for Sunday School - Then we had 
                    dinner - beans - cornbread biscuits - fried potatoes - pickled beets - cucumber pickles - cake - pie &amp; coffee! <pb ref="arm03040014007" seq="07" n="03"></pb>
                    The whole family never sit down to the table when you visit - the man of the house does usually &amp; the women wait - so Polly &amp; her mother 
                    <hi1 rend="underscore">waited</hi1>. Mr. <abbr expan="McCarter">McC.</abbr> was away. Mr. Cresswell arrived in the course of time with Dan &amp; the buggy - 
                    We started back about four - we girls riding &amp; the two youths walking - having had a very nice time. I have spent the <abbr expan="evening">eve.</abbr> 
                    since reading Abby &amp; I refraining from <abbr expan="Baptist Young Person&apos;s Union">B.Y.</abbr> - for <hi1 rend="underscore">once</hi1>! Emily &amp; 
                    Evelyn attended.
                </p>
                <pb ref="arm03040014008" seq="08"></pb>
                <p>
                    Well the lamp is going out &amp; it&apos;s about 9:40 &amp; bedtime again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <del>Wonder what I will have decided two weeks from tonight! I do want to see you all <hi1 rend="underscore">so</hi1> much but 
                    just can&apos;t think of visiting around in Tacoma &amp; Seattle somehow - wish you&apos;d consider coming east to see me if I stay.</del>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just loads of love as ever -
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ruth.
