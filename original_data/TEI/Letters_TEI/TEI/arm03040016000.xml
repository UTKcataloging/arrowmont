                         <gap reason="illegible" resp="bds"></gap> school closes that morning - Shall mend - clear - pack - write letters - &amp; do some visiting &amp; take a few
                         more kodak pictures - so expect to have a busy time. Aunt Lizzie &amp; Mrs. <sic corr="Proffitt">Profitt</sic> will both be here.</del>

                        Oh <hi1 rend="underscore">yes</hi1> will you please send me my kodak pictures - have decided it costs too much to have two sets and think I had better keep
                        them all in my new kodak book - The Washington D. C. Pi Phis know of my coming &amp; no doubt I&apos;ll have to show them the pictures &amp; talk about
                    the school - &amp; a book will be better than loose ones - Those I&apos;m en-</del><pb ref="arm03040016003" seq="03"></pb><del>closing you have not seen I believe &amp; will 
                        you send them back with the others? I do not want the New Orleans pictures nor those of myself or those of the relations - just the <abbr expan="Gatlinburg">burg</abbr>
                        Sevierville - environs - people etc. Do you suppose you can get them to me before I leave here?</del>

                <p>
                    Well to return to an account of my doings from Wednesday night on - After school that is about 4 p.m. for the play had to be gone over
                    first - Emily - Lucrettie - Cora Ogle &amp; I and oh yes Abby took the trail for Tom <sic corr="Campbell">Camel&apos;s</sic> - cloudy afternoon but the 
                    <abbr expan="mountains">mts</abbr> were lovely &amp; I see my first arbutus blossom - lovely too - Have you seen them? We had not been to the
                    <pb ref="arm03040016004" seq="04"></pb> <sic corr="Campbell&apos;">Camel&apos;</sic>&apos;s since our mountains visit last summer - when we took the tramp with them &amp;
                    wound up with moonshine - 
                </p>
                <p>
                    They were both at home and entertaining a married daughter &amp; child - Mrs. <abbr expan="Campbell">C.</abbr> sat before the fire smoking a big &quot;store
                    pipe&quot; (her corncob not visible anywhere) and holding the two year old granddaughter a pathetic little thing who wouldn&apos;t smile at all - her hair tied in tight
                    braids with rags - shoes tied on her feet with the same as they were so torn they would have fallen off otherwise - her undergarment (diaper) consisting of 
                    <add place="supralinear">pieces of</add> an old kitchen apron - Friday little Blanche &amp; Mattie Huff came over after school &amp; for the night - I took them for a walk
                    when I got home - We went up the river road &amp; called on Mrs. Russell Ogle who is just recovering from the flu &amp; is almost a skeleton is very thin anyway &amp;
                    tubercular too I imagine. Blanche &amp; Mattie played <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">empinole</unclear> with Abby &amp; me after supper - a most 
                    hilarious performance - Then Blanche &amp; I went to bed - was much flattered to be elected as hostess for Miss <abbr expan="Blanche">B.</abbr> for the night - 
                    She is a cute thing - is in Emily&apos;s room - Mattie is in Abbie&apos;s - They are both pretty as pictures - Yesterday it tried to snow in the <abbr expan="morning">a.m.</abbr>
                    but cleared off finally into a beautiful day - but I remained inside - did my Saturday work - wrote letters read &amp; fussed around generally went to bed early. Emily did
                    most of her packing - Blanche &amp; Mattie were here &amp; there &amp; everywhere helping &amp; enjoying the confusion generally - Little Lucinda Oakley came in - 
                    she had been to the store to get some new shoes &amp; stopped &quot;to warm&quot; winding up by staying until after <pb ref="arm03040016005" seq="05" n="3"></pb> lunch - 
                    Emily went home with her to tell them good bye - 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today the other girls went to Sunday School but as I shall be here two more Sundays decided to enjoy the lovely morning &amp; walk over to the Carr&apos;s where we
                    four girls had been invited for dinner. I don&apos;t enjoy riding over these rough roads &amp; as the other girls wanted to ride we were all quite satisfied. So about
                    <del>8:30</del><add place="supralinear">9:00</add> I set off with my kodak &amp; strolled along the Roaring Fork Road meeting various ones bound
                    for Sunday School although the last bell had rung some time before - They make no effort to arrive on time whatsoever - Saw a number of butterflies red bird - 
                    (do you know it?) <hi1 rend="underscore">bees</hi1> - crows - squirrel - About two mile up the creek you take a footlog and go through a yard <pb ref="arm03040016006" seq="06"></pb>
                    close to the cabin &amp; on up a ridge then down &amp; finally up again and to a long narrow holler after a short steep climb - It&apos;s a three mile walk &amp; their
                    miles are <hi1 rend="underscore">not</hi1> <hi1 rend="underscore">short</hi1>! The girls arrived about half an hour later - Mr. &amp; Mrs. Carr are very &quot;good clever
                    people but old fashioned&quot; to quote Aunt Lizzie - They keep their children in school right along one boy and four girls - divided among the three rooms - They gossip 
                    terribly and have not the fine principles of the McCarters! Litha and Rose are planning to go to Carson-Newman College next year - a Baptist school in Jefferson City - 
                    small town in northeastern <abbr expan="Tennessee">Tenn.</abbr> - They have two brothers there now in school - We girls say that all the mischief making - (quarrels 
                    among the girls) <del>are</del> always goes back to <pb ref="arm03040016007" seq="07"></pb> one of the Carrs - Well they were all very pleasant to us &amp; 
                    did their best - We had the usual dinner in the kitchen - Then they got together their small flock of sheep &amp; we took pictures later tramping over the rockiest field - 
                    nothing but rocks - over a ridge up &amp; down for a good long mile to Roaring Fork. After our return we sat around the fire &amp; started home about 3:30 - the girls 
                    drove &amp; I walked with Ethel and Maud Clabo - the latter lives with her grandmother not far from them &amp; came over during dinner. The two little girls stayed for 
                    supper &amp; went to <abbr expan="Baptist Young Person&apos;s Union">B.Y.</abbr> - Emily &amp; I didn&apos;t go - I did my school work &amp; 
                    <abbr expan="Emily">E.</abbr> wrote a letter. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It&apos;s &quot;now&quot; more than bedtime &amp; <del>I must wind up this long epistle. Do consider the wild plan in the first part of letter
                    very seriously won&apos;t you? I really would like to find something else to do besides teaching &amp; shall make an effort strenuously to do so - If I do not
                    succeed will then come back here no doubt - unless they find someone else as I told Miss Langmaid not to hesistate to do. Thank
                    you for the offer of money - will need it if I come home but hope to earn enough to carry me through.</del>
