                    Dearest Jane - <del>Wrote you a long letter <abbr expan="Wednesday">Wed.</abbr>
						<abbr expan="evening">eve.</abbr> so as 
                        it&apos;s late anyway will not write very much tonight - Wonder what all you have been doing today!</del> It&apos;s been lovely these last three 
                    or four days - another cold frosty spell with lots of sunshine - Our milk has had chunks of ice in it every morning!
                </p>

                    Miss Langmaid &amp; Evelyn came back about 1:30 that afternoon quite pleased to return. After school we all went on a call about two miles away 
                    on Little Dudley Creek where a family of McCarters live (there are nearly as many of them as Ogles &amp; Reagan&apos;s) Arlie the oldest boy 
                    whom I had in school a little while cut his hand badly as I think I told you in one my letters &amp; is in the Knoxville General Hospital - There are six or 
                    seven boys in the family down to the baby and one little girl - None of them are in school as they should be - They help their mother about the place &amp; 
                    two about twelve and nine work for Mr. Huff <pb ref="arm03030017003" seq="03"/>at his mill. We asked Mrs. <abbr expan="McCarter">MC</abbr> how old 
                    one of them was &amp; she said she didn&apos;t know! We got home just in time of supper - Aunt Lizzie was quite impatient over it as we had kept 
                    her soup waiting. In the evening we sat around visiting &amp; I darted off a letter to papa - Miss <abbr expan="Langmaid">L.</abbr> &amp; Evelyn 
                    went to Huff<del>&apos;</del>s on business.
                </p>
				<p>
                    Friday Evelyn came over after school &amp; drilled the youngsters on some Thanksgiving songs - &amp; I tried out some of my play as usual. 
                    Then later we made a little call on Squire Maples&apos; family at the foot of the lane &amp; then as Dr. Massey went by we rushed out &amp; 
                    got in the buggy - all three of us &amp; went about a mile down the road - as we were returning Mr. Huff overtook us in his Ford so we returned 
                    on four wheels to the burg even as we had left it.
                </p>
				<p>
                    The debate came off as soon as we could get over after supper &amp; <pb ref="arm03030017004" seq="04"/> quite heated it proved to be - we all 
                    enjoyed it very much. Saturday I was so busy sweeping &amp; fussing around all day it seemed until just before dark when Emily &amp; I 
                    went over to Huff&apos;s for dinner &amp; the night - Had a very nice time - but was glad to return here this <abbr expan="morning">a.m.</abbr> 
                    about 9 &amp; just in time for Sunday School - After that we had a hasty <hi1 rend="underscore">snack</hi1> &amp; then went <del>with</del> 
                    via Lillard Mables&apos; Ford about five miles up into the Sugar Lands to the home of the Pricketts who used to teach here you know. They live in a 
                    two room house which is rather small quarters for them &amp; their two babies - Of course we had to have dinner with them so that it was all three &amp; 
                    nearer four when we left - We walked most of the way home missing connections with Lillard who overtook us about a mile from the burg - Then it was 
                    a bowl of potato soup &amp; <abbr expan="Baptist Young Person&apos;s Union">B.Y.P.</abbr> - However was spared the quartet this time Mr. Cresswell 
                    having a very bad cold - Well we all sat around the fire until about nine - then I did some studying &amp; started up here to bed after first writing my 
                    dear Jane - Hope you won&apos;t mind this scrappy letter but just can&apos;t elaborate on things tonight - all this visiting is strenuous &amp; rather 
                    tiresome at times It&apos;s hard to listen to one person talk so much!
                </p>
				<p>
                    We are all going to be up to our eyes with Thanksgiving festivities this week but will no doubt emerge in the end!
                </p>
				<p>
                    With more love than I can tell you - Ruth.
                </p>
