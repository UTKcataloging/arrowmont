                    Dearest family - Just home from <abbr expan="Baptist Young Person&apos;s Union">B.Y.</abbr> &amp; 7 by the clock - you see we begin early so as to get it over with. 
                    Emily is sitting near me also writing - Evelyn is at the other end of the table fixing kodak pictures in her album - Tom &amp; Mr. Creswell are discussing  manual training &amp; 
                    lumber with Miss Langmaid - Aunt Lizzie is trying to read &amp; at the same time keep up with everything that&apos;s going on. Abbie has just <add place="supralinear">gone</add>
                    over to her house as the girls came - sometimes they go back home after <abbr expan="Baptist Young Person&apos;s Union">B.Y.</abbr> &amp; then Abbie joyfully remains here.
                    Since writing you Wednesday as usual have buzzed around - though do not seem to have accomplished so very much somehow. I got your package off yesterday noon - do not 
                    be startled by the size &amp; do not open it until Christmas please - will you? Just think a week from tonight will be our first night in New Orleans am so glad we are going as
                    otherwise I fear it would be rather a <pb ref="arm03030027003" seq="03"/> dismal season for us both so far away from everybody. Emily had a note from the Woman&apos;s 
                    Christian Exchange Saturday saying that at present they were full &amp; did not  know how it would be when we arrived. We are going to see them anyway in case there should 
                    be a vacancy - We have been told of another place - a private boarding house taht some cousin of Emily&apos;s  has recommended. Shall wear my big coat &amp; black 
                    dress - pheasant hat when starting forth - take my little old black hat - tan dress - light blue dress - and suit - what else I don&apos;t know - thought of sticking in my old red - 
                    but its so shabby &amp; spotted  that I have my doubts. My kodak is going - also Emily&apos;s star book - my pictures to show any Pi Phis I may meet. As there are horse
                    races going on at the time we expect to be there - it will be rather crowded so we are writing to the <abbr expan="Saint">St.</abbr> Charles Hotel - for a room for the first night
                    there. It&apos;s <hi1 rend="underscore">the</hi1> hotel but <pb ref="arm03030027004" seq="04"/> we think it will be fun <del>the</del>
					<add place="supralinear">our</add>
                    first apperance to make a splash &amp; then subside into a respectable &amp; cheap place. Up here everyone speaks to those met on the street - rather road - all the way to 
                    Sevierville &amp; in fact in every direction so there&apos;s no telling how we will act on the streets of the city (my sentences are rather wild as there have been many 
                    interruptions - the youths have left - Miss Langmaid has started on her kodak book &amp; <del>with</del>
					<add place="supralinear">like</add> Evelyn has to have
                    help every little while &amp; Emily &amp; I have written our letters for rooms.)
                </p>

                       Jane&apos;s letter &amp; pa&apos;s came this past week pa&apos;s all enthusiasm over California &amp; Jane&apos;s containing not a word. I just don&apos;t know
                       what to say about it - Do you think Palo Alto is a good place? It seems so awful to go away from  the children &amp; everybody - don&apos;t see how you can - As to where
						I&apos;ll be next year I do not know how things will turn out - My letter from the <abbr expan="superintendent&apos;s">supt&apos;s</abbr> office was in regard to my donation of 
                       &#36;6 towards the retirement fund - It was due <abbr expan="November">Nov.</abbr> 10th but as I did not get the letter in time &amp; as I can&apos;t imagine myself
                       teaching there again have not answered it. Hate to put more money into it &amp; yet do not know as it&apos;s quite wise to take the fatal step &amp; sever all connections with 
                       <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">th</unclear> it.</del>
                   </p>
				<p><del>
                        Isn&apos;t it awful not to know your own mind?</del>
                    </p>
				<p>
                    Thursday after school we practiced as usual - Friday Emily went home with Abbie - Mr. <abbr expan="Creswell">C.</abbr> had gone to <abbr expan="Sevierville">S.</abbr>
                    the day before as his brother was very sick - the one who teaches in Murphy - He had skinned his arm playing <sic corr="basketball">basket-ball</sic> blood poisoning resulting - 
                    They finally took him to the hospital Friday night.
                </p>
				<p>
                    We three Pi Phis and Harrison went <pb ref="arm03030027005" seq="05"/> around the establishment - climbed up the hill back of the house to the line and then scrambled down
                    again - It was very rough walking through the laurel - pines - holly etc. We picked galax leaves or colt&apos;s foot as Mrs. <sic corr="Proffitt">Proffit</sic> calls them - two bunches 
                    of which I put in your <abbr expan="Christmas">Xmas</abbr> box - one for the children - They will last for a long time if in water. Evelyn says they are sent up north to the florists&apos;
                    shops.
                </p>
				<p>
                    We got home just in time to clean up &amp; eat &amp; then take our lamps &amp; go over  to the debate. which began about 6:15. Early hours we have! The subject was - 
                    grazing is more important in these mountains than farming. The youngsters in school are quite interested in doing their part and really behave nicely. After this Evelyn played
                    for singing a little while - they all <pb ref="arm03030027006" seq="06"/> just love to sing.
                </p>
				<p>
                    Saturday noon Dr. Massy&apos;s office girl Christine Jenkins &amp; Abbie&apos;s young sister Willa May arrived with the horse &amp; buggy - Christine having come up to
                    give Charley Ogle&apos;s mother serum treatment - she is in the last stages of tuberculosis they say - they had lunch &amp; got ready to start back about three - Evelyn&apos;s
                    mother had sent word for her to come home but she felt she couldn&apos;t &amp; finally <hi1 rend="underscore">I</hi1> went - just left all my mending &amp; everything that 
                    should have been done - snatched up a few possessions &amp; piled into the buggy &amp; away we went for a <hi1 rend="underscore">long</hi1>
					<hi1 rend="underscore">long</hi1>
                    ride - The road was indescribable - mud holes fearful - &amp; a little drizzly rain most of the way. It was lots of fun anyway though dark before we reached Abbie&apos;s - 
                    (about a mile this side of Sevierville) Then it came down in torrents - &amp; <pb ref="arm03030027007" seq="07"/> kept it up till way in the night - Abbie lives in a big rambling
                    farmhouse - her mother is blind but gets around wonderfully well - the other sisters &amp; brother go to Murphy College - They are very plain people &amp; live the same - but
                    imagine there is plenty of money salted down somewhere. It was six when we arrived &amp; supper over - but some biscuits - jam - fried pork - etc. were soon ready - after
                    which we scrambled out through the rain into a Ford sent up from town to go to a lecture at the college. The lecturer raved on &amp; on for practically three hours - Brooks
                    Fletcher or Fletcher Brooks - of the Redpath Lyceum Circuit - He had lectured the night before on good roads &amp; community work but branched out into hygiene - will power
                    psychology - survival of the fittest &amp; such - He also informed the audience that it was rumored that he was going to be proposed for <abbr expan="Governor">gov.</abbr> of 
                    Ohio next year &amp; he hoped it was true - owns a newspaper &amp; <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">caste</unclear> grocery giving lectures on the side! To cut a long 
                    story short - we were pleased to roll into a soft feather bed &amp; stay there till 8 a.m. It turned cold in the night with a sprinkle of snow - 
                    coldest yet. We stayed right around the fireplace all morning &amp; had dinner early so we could start back with Dan &amp; the buggy about 1 - a hot brick for each of us was 
                    very comfortable.
                </p>

                    So you see another weekend has flitted by &amp; now comes the last pull before we can <hi1 rend="underscore">kick</hi1>
					<hi1 rend="underscore">over</hi1>
					<hi1 rend="underscore">the</hi1>
					<hi1 rend="underscore">traces</hi1>!
                </p>

                    With just loads &amp; loads of love to each &amp; all as ever
                </p>
