                    Dearest Jane - The day before Thanksgiving and isn&apos;t it strange to be sitting here way off on the other side of the U.S. nibbling your 
                    <hi1 rend="underscore">grand</hi1> old salted nuts &amp; the delicious candies and you all getting ready for a <hi1 rend="underscore">real</hi1>
                    <hi1 rend="underscore">dinner</hi1> for tomorrow - Who would have thought it a year ago? Pa wrote me that he expected to be home for 
                    Thanksgiving - so you will surely have a house full! The eats came this noon &amp; just knew there would be salted nuts somehow - the first
                    I&apos;ve had for months - The card arrived at the same time so dear Jane your doubly - nay <hi1 rend="underscore">trebly</hi1> sweet 
                    <hi1 rend="underscore">thoughts are much appreciated.</hi1> It&apos;s 3:30 this dark &amp; rainy <abbr expan="afternoon">p.m.</abbr> - the house
                    seems perfectly quiet &amp; still - Evelyn Miss Langmaid &amp; Emily have gone to the store to see about stuff for dinner tomorrow - Aunt Lizzie
                    is I know not where - so am enjoying an unusual calm in my own room. A calm is enjoyable too for the program came off this <abbr expan="afternoon">p.m.</abbr>
                    &amp; there was a grand cleaning-up afterwards. This was </del><pb ref="arm03030022003" seq="03"></pb> <del>followed on my part by my hustling up here - 
                    putting away my washing - hanging <add place="supralinear">up</add> my coats &amp; gowns - getting into a wash dress - putting my little union
                    suits to soak &amp; then subsiding into the rocker by the open window. Such sudden changes of temperature! Yesterday <abbr expan="morning">a.m.</abbr>
                    we all ate breakfast on the back porch - no wraps either. What do you think of that?</del>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please don&apos;t hustle yourself too much with the sweater - Isn&apos;t it an awfully hard color to work on very steadily? Know I shall be quite wild 
                    about it when it arrives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I&apos;m wondering about Christmas - Do you think I ought to send my relations anything - Aunt Lottie &amp; the rest of them? It doesn&apos;t seem as
                    though Thanksgiving <sic corr="was">were</sic> so near - and Christmas &amp; New Orleans a month off! Baskets are so hard to get &amp; such a 
                    demand for them too that I may not be able to get what I want for you and Nellie - <pb ref="arm03030022004" seq="04"></pb> in time for <abbr expan="Christmas">Xmas</abbr> - 
                    it&apos;s baskets of course &amp; very different from those I&apos;ve sent - Hope you liked the others as well as you expected.
                 </p>    
                <p>
                    Thanksgiving afternoon - 2:45
                </p>
                <p>
                     Got just so far &amp; then had to stop as my brain &amp; hand did not seem to work together - Read a little while &amp; then went to sleep - Spent the evening
                    luxuriously looking over The Atlantic &amp; my papers! This morning Emily &amp; I cleaned as usual &amp; fixed the table - 10 people - Mr. &amp; Mrs. Huff &amp;
                    the two little girls - (Blanche &amp; Mattie -) Aunt Lizzie &amp; Mrs. <sic corr="Proffitt">Profitt</sic> - we three Pi Phis &amp; Emily - Fixed a centerpiece of autumn 
                    leaves holly &amp; sprigs of something they call &quot;red bud&quot; - in one of the baskets - Then had some tiny ones at each place filled with the salted nuts &amp;
                    a little <add place="supralinear">place</add> card - Took the initials of everyone - Evelyn&apos;s was &quot;Entertains Brightly&quot; - Evelyn&apos;s - &quot;Ever Busy&quot; - 
                    Mr. Huff&apos;s &quot;A Hustler&quot; - Mrs. <abbr expan="Huff">H.</abbr> - &quot;Manage<del>r</del>s <del>of</del> Households&quot; - 
                    etc. The table looked very nice with all our new dishes - stuffed chicken - sweet potatoes - gravy - rice - hot biscuits - jelly - pineapple salad - mince pie &amp; coffee - It took
                    us all morning to get things ready - the Huffs came at 11:30 just as I started for the mail - <del>Was so pleased to get a letter from you Jane - &amp; one
                        from pa mailed at San Diego - I got another one from him yesterday which had been sent to Texas - the second that has gone there - Isn&apos;t it strange? Suppose he&apos;s
                        home today! and you all had a <hi1 rend="underscore">big</hi1> turkey dinner. Poor Jane - don&apos;t try to do too much for Mrs. Webster - We make a lot more of our guests
                        than many people do - seems to me.</del>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It&apos;s turned cold &amp; cloudy &amp; snow is being predicted by our weather prophet - Aunt Lizzie - The Huffs are gone &amp; Mr. Huff has just returned with the Ford
                    to take Evelyn &amp; Miss Langmaid to Sevierville - They want to visit an industrial school in North Carolina getting back here about <pb ref="arm03030022005" seq="05"></pb>
                    Monday - Emily decided to ride down &amp; back with Mr. Huff - but I&apos;m pleased to be alone for awhile &amp; get a few little things done. Mrs. Huff insisted on Emily
                    &amp; me going over for supper tonight &amp; staying till tomorrow so guess that&apos;s the program - though I much prefer staying here &amp; sleeping in my own little bed - 
                    Such is life in Gatlinburg! My hair needs washing - my stockings darning - &amp; several garments mending - besides some school work to plan - letters to write etc. 
                    Next Friday there is to be a &quot;box supper&quot; at the school to raise money for books for our library &amp; Evelyn has decided that she&apos;d like my play given again
                    that night too! Our program proved a great success - Monday night the stage &amp; curtains were put up - Tuesday afternoon we went through the whole performance - Wednesday
                    <abbr expan="morning">a.m.</abbr> had a few classes &amp; decorated <pb ref="arm03030022006" seq="06"></pb> with greens &amp; autumn leaves - having gone over the night
                    before &amp; planned it - the whole bunch of us! The oak trees are wonderful now - the maples &amp; gums being practically bare - Our performance began about one - The 
                    stage was across the front of my room taking a little more than half - &amp; the panel on the side was let down - the other raised giving entrance &amp; exit &amp; the extra
                    space filled in by the piano - big screen &amp; greens - First my room &amp; Abbie&apos;s were grouped on the stage &amp; sang a Thanksgiving song - then Emily&apos;s
                    little youngsters sang too - next Abbie&apos;s class had a little performance about the months with a lot of singing etc lasting a good twenty minutes - Some of the older girls sang
                    a song - then Emily&apos;s youngsters gave theirs - meanwhile I was fussing around in the sewing room pinning on collars &amp; cuffs - painting the Indian etc. etc.
                    <pb ref="arm03030022007" seq="07"></pb> Mr. Cresswell blacked very wonderful mustaches - side burns &amp; beards on the boys&apos; faces - I made three big Puritan hats &amp; they
                    looked like the real thing too - thanks to my lessons in millinery - It was a job blackening them however. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There were seven scenes - &amp; all went very well too - Estel made a very nice John Alden - big white collar &amp; cuffs over his dark blue suit - big wide ribbon round his
                    waist - bows on his shoes &amp; at his knees - Puritan hat &amp; Emily&apos;s blue cape for outdoor scene - Tom made a splendid captain - had a real helmet - sword - belt of
                    cartridges &amp; powder horn <add place="supralinear">big boots &amp;</add> - stamped around &amp; warmed up to the part generally - Cora was very pretty in her two 
                    spinning scenes - Had the whole class on the stage for the wedding scene &amp; wound up <del>by</del> <add place="supralinear">with</add> a 
                    Thanksgiving song. Several have said it was the best program ever given - Evelyn told me that plays had been attempted here before but that they never went off well as this
                    one did - which pleased me. 
                </p>

                        Had a card from Uncle Art thanking me for the basket &amp; saying that they had sold the old homestead at last &amp; were going to the Evanston Hotel - a very new
                        &amp; swell place - also very expensive. Aunt Lottie was keen to get there when I saw her last summer - so guess she&apos;s happy now.</del>
