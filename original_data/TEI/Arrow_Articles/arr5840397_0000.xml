       <p>A Message to all alumnae clubs and active chapters The Holt House Committee announces that the Holt house is open for the use of all groups in Pi Beta Phi as a place for entertaining. The Committee is anxious to have all members of the Fraternity visit the house, and also to have them use it for group gatherings of any kind. A very small fee must be charged for such use.

As a member of the Executive Board of the Local Chapter of the Red Cross, and Chairman of the Committee on Community Welfare, our Pi Phi Health Center nurse is taking an active part in organizing and furthering adult first aid classes, and all possible instruction vital to our National Defense Program. Every staff member and all School facilities combine to give all possible cooperation to the community participation in the emergency demands. It is the belief of the Settlement School Committee that war needs may necessitate a greater service from Pi Phi, and some increased use of our plant and staff. just what need will be our added privilege to serve we do not know, but we are confident that if a need presents itself the strength of Pi Phi's will to serve will make possible our meeting that need with credit. With no lessening of our already pledged service, we expect to meet additional responsibilities as they come. No worthy burden is too great when backed by the united effort of 11 B (D. </p>
