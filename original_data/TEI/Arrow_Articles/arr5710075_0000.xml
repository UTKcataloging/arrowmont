       <p>S ttiement School eports :!:HAI MAN OF THE SETTLEMENT SCHOOL C MMITTEE 1'r the 1940 Convention of the U B Fraternity: r..NcE the founding of the Settlement School in 1910 there have been twelve chairmen, each Irving . mg a term of from one to five years. In this umber have been women illustrious for their -ork for the School and the Fraternity. No doubt ich one had feelings much as I have at the end E a term of service which has covered a period E five years, four of them as Chairman. There a feeling of gratitude to the Fraternity for the ppOrtunity of serving in this capacity. Whatever mount of time, thought, and energy the work has Leh, I feel a thousand times rewarded by the Ltisfaction of the accomplishment and progress lat have been made. The progress during the past four years may nly seem greater than that in any other period of le same length. In reading old reports one finds any statements of the rapid growth of the Burg, it has been affectionately called. As the Burg rew the School expanded or, more properly )eaking, as the School expanded, Gatlinburg grew )r the mountain people were anxious to give ieir children an education and so moved nearer le School. When I started my term on the Corn mittee a new element had begun to add its force in the ever-changing community. The Smoky Mountain National Park had been located with Gatlin-berg as the Tennessee entrance. Also, the years of greatest depression, when many eliminations had to be made, were over. I have been fortunate to serve during a period when expansion was both necessary and possible, although it has entailed much careful planning and close attention. I have reported each year to the Fraternity through the Information ARROW so a detailed re-port of only the past year is necessary. However I am sure that adding some of the major accomplishments of the four years of my chairmanship will be valuable in giving you a picture of the work that we are now doing in Gatlinburg. Although other chairmen have reported great progress and rapid changes with attendant expansion for the then present and future needs, a new program of expansion had to be instigated at the beginning of my term of service. The high school was in the process of changing from a two to a four year course, thus giving our young people further educational opportunity. This is possible to put our home economics and agricul FINANCIAL CHART OF PI BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL INCOME GATLINBURG, TENNESSEE School Year Clubs Chapters Magazine County and Agency State 1911-1912 ........ ....... ....... 1912-1913 $ 300.25 $ 152.00 ....... ........ 1913-1914 1,589.84 500.32 ....... $ 1,200..00 1914-1915 3,841.19 2,150.90 ....... 1,575.00 1915-1916 3,312.10 164.40 $ 114.00 409.50 1916-1917 3,238.32 235.78 118.82 320.00 1917-1918 2,623.06 62.00 131.24 425.00 1918-1919 3,363.63 ....... 185.00 340.00 1919-1920 6,439.53 407.18 404.20 425.00 '1920-1921 12,463.52 1,138.12 461.00 1,000.00 1921-1922 16,116.10 2,779.85 360.61 875.00 1922-1923 18,070.96 1,899.34 520.50 2,000.00 1923-1924 19,862.64 2,148.18 407.00 2,913.80 1924-1925 20,709.50 2,638.97 600.00 5,863.00 1925-1926 18,345.43 2,412.58 700.00 6,025.00 1926-1927 19,481.08 3,048.98 1,172.47 4,228.15 1927-1928 24,011.77 3,212.60 1,500.00 5,500.00 1928-1929 23,564.82 3,455.25 1,573.98 5,769.00 1929-1930 23,440.51 3,886.30 860.00 5,586.76 1930-1931 21,297.88 3,814.15 App. * 1931-1932 16,788.35 2,451.17 1,698.89 1932-1933 11,040.45 2,077.34 1,400.00 1933-1934 12,899.35 2,162.86 2,012.18 1934-1935 11,335.01 1,824.86 1,940.49 4,945.00 1935-1936 11,721.63 2,101.57 1,435.12 5,540.00 1936-1937 12,069.94 2,289.04 2,366.48 6,615.00 1937-1938 11,396.40 2,121.99 2,445.09 9,540.00 1938-1939 10,746.81 2,104.85 2,793.10 App. 1939-1940 11,267.84 2,117.67 3,153.00 11,870.50 * Approximately the same. 74 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 75 tare courses on the Smith-Hughes basis, federal and state funds furnishing half the salaries, the other half being financed from the School budget. This year a crafts course was added on the same basis, Arrow Craft profits being used for our half of the salary. The county cooperates by paying three other high school teachers. The county also pays the salaries of all elementary teachers and pays $100 per month rent for the elementary building, making a total of $11,870.50 this past year. This expanded program for the high school combined with the rapid increase in the elementary school necessitated more room. The elementary school outgrew its five room building and one by one grades have been put into the high school building. This crowded the high school building, which was erected twelve years ago with the idea that it was large enough for all time, to the extent that two years ago it was necessary to add a wing to house science and home economics laboratories. Next year the elementary school will need an-other room which can be made available by pushing the high school still farther into the Voorheis building from which the weaving has been moved to the new Arrow Craft building. The Committee has recommended and Grand Council approved that at some not far distant date the elementary school, not including the building, be turned over entirely to the county. The county now pays the whole expense of the elementary school and should soon be able to house and super-vise it. This should eliminate future need of any more buildings for school purposes financed by the Fraternity. At present we have a modern, attractive high school plant which is visited by groups from the University interested in vocational and other types of education. Our high school faculty is headed by William King, the efficient principal who has been with us ten years and has made himself al-most indispensable to the School and the community. With him Ben Fleming, a graduate of our school and of Tusculum College not only is a teacher and coach of ability but also wields a great influence for good in the community. Marian Ryan and Rosalie Ellis, Pi Phis from New York r and Kansas B respectively, have been excellent teachers and leaders and have endeared themselves to the community. Unfortunately both are leaving but two Pi Phis, Cleo Nelson, North Dakota A, and Charlotte Herman, Illinois Z, have been employed to take their places. William Coe has continued with the vocational agriculture and has given adult instruction in outlying communities in addition to teaching the high school agriculture and managing our farm. In the latter he has been assisted by Ambers Ogle and the dormitory boys. The new course in wood and metal crafts has been taught by Wm. Oakes who has had the high school boys and girls for three hours each morning and adults in the afternoon and evening. This work will be continued during the summer months, the old Arrow Craft building being used as a laboratory. As I have already stated, the elementary school is entirely supported by the county but is under our supervision. The teachers are recommended by us and elected by the county board. Half of them are county girls and half Pi Phis. The elementary school is under the direction of C. Pern Price who has been untiring in his efforts to raise the standard and this year the school received an A rating under the Tennessee school code. Our Pi Phi elementary teachers, Marie Amacker, Tennessee A, Pauline Morris, New York A, and Ruth Parker, Pennsylvania B, have done excellent teaching and directed extracurricular activities. Ruth Parker, after two years of outstanding service, has resigned and Flora Belle DeWitt, Colorado B, will take her place. Another II (I, Doris Hatch, Illinois A, has been elected to teach next year as the number enrolled in the grades warrants another teacher. Three county girls, Pauline Sharp, Veryl Elder, and Sarabeth Lewis have also done much to make this a successful year. Next year Eleanor Brabson will return to teach the first grade. With the enlarged high school building, added equipment, and an excellent teaching staff the past year has been one of great accomplishment for our school children. School activities of unusual worth have been open to all. Basketball and playground activities have taken care of physical development and public speaking contests, plays, home ec and ag clubs, boy and girl scouts have given opportunity for intellectual and spiritual growth. In her closing report to the 1936 Convention, my predecessor, Frankie Cochran Hill, pointed with pride to the first year of the expansion in our high school program. I now report with pride the accomplishments of four more years. Our "Five year plan" was not made with that as a definite time time for a report but it happens that we have accomplished all and more than we hoped five years ago. The emphasis on the vocational subjects added to the academic subjects gives a broader scope to the course. The crafts course has been something of an experiment this year as it is not planned along ordinary manual training lines but is designed to give training in making articles useful in homes and also those saleable as gifts. Handwork is recognized by educators as important in the development of youth. To quote Angelo Patri, a noted educator, "Children need to learn to use their hands. They need every experience that handwork will bring them. This is not only to train them in skill but to heighten their intelligence. Handwork reacts directly upon the intelligence of the worker and the more creative the work the greater the power stored by the experience. Let the boys whittle and saw and hammer and plane by hand. Let the girls sew and cook and clean and paint and model and weave, by hand." It is my hope that the crafts work will be not only continued, but supplemented by an art course which will add to the creative ability of our Gatlinburg people the artistic and the beautiful. To art there should be added music, that other art which adds so much to the moral and spiritual as well as the artistic well being of a school and a community. And so, though I report with pride the advancement of the school work at the end of a five year period, there are still things to be done, things for future chairmen to report. For, although the county takes care of the elementary school and a part of the high school, the Fraternity is adding the things which give our boys and girls of the Gatlinburg community an opportunity that most of them would never have if it were not for </p>

       <p>'6 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW ur help. We must keep on and improve still [lore our high school work. Hand in hand with the school work goes our iealth work. A sound mind in a healthy body is n old but wise but still true statement. Our health crork over the years has eliminated many of the lls like hookworm which were prevalent in the any days, but health work must be kept up. This Las been done and our nurse is constantly busy vith preventive and curative measures. One venders how our Marjorie Chalmers, R.N., can lo so much. I might fill pages with stories of her ministrations. The old man dying of cancer, the regnant woman, the patient rushed to the Knox-rifle hospital for an emergency, the mother of the hild whose club foot was straightened, the vicim of an automobile accident, the boy with a cut finger, all testify to her skillful ministrations. The :aunty furnishes serums but is able to do little nore for our community. Although a doctor has low located in Gatlinburg, the work of our nurse 's none the less needed. Our little hospital is a tery busy place and Mrs. Chalmer's work has riven her an enduring place in the hearts of our 3atlinburg people. Now I come to Arrow Craft. You all know the story of our part in the revival of the handicrafts. "ou know of the increase in our weaving and andicraft business. Our Director of Arrow Craft, Ethel Weaver Snow, Iowa r, has worked untiringly to achieve these results. Our Weaving Supervisor, Gene Redding, has designed, and ;upervised the making of all the woven articles. Ms includes besides the designing the ordering )f supplies, giving out materials, watching the weaving done in the homes, checking in the fin-:shed products, figuring cost and selling prices, Ind marking. The products are then turned over :o Mrs. Snow who directs the sale both through alumnae clubs and in our two shops in Gatlinburg. .Wrs. Snow also attends to the production and )uying of all the other handicrafts found on our )rice list. Gene Redding assisted by Mrs. Snow Lod Mrs. Georgia Duffield manage the Weavers' Build which has become such an important part )f our work. Out of it have come the Garden -dlub, which has done so much in beautifying the comes and the highway of Gatlinburg, and the Weaver's play, which is being given once a week :his summer in order to preserve and portray for he traveling public the old customs of the moun-:ain people. I have referred before to my predecessor's re-)ort at the 1936 Convention. In it she reports the )est business that Arrow Craft had ever done. She also reported the moving of weaving production nto the Voorheis building. I started my term as 2hairman with Arrow Craft a paying and a growng business. Due to the increased interest in handi-:rafts, to increased travel through Gatlinburg, and :o increased effort on the part of our Alumnae ;tubs, Arrow Craft has continued to be a paying tnd a growing business. It has been evident for ome years that a new Arrow Craft building was leeded. Our shop was housed in the old school )wilding and although it was attractive on the :orner by Baskins Creek and we had a sentimental attachment to it, it could never be comfortably :seated in winter. With the weaving stock in the Voorheis building about three hundred feet away here was much walking back and forth and pack ing had to be done in both buildings. It was decided that housing the production, shipping, and shop under one roof would add greatly to the efficiency of the business. Much time was spent considering the most advantageous location, two or three being available on our property. During the years, Arrow Craft profit had accumulated until we decided at our meeting last summer that there was enough to pay for an adequate building and still leave an adequate surplus. Grand Council approved our using a sum of $10,000 for building and equipment. Barber and McMurray, Knoxville architects who planned the addition to the high school, drew the plans. The old Arrow Craft building was moved back toward the Voorheis building and the new building placed on the location of the old one. Several months were taken to get the plans made to fit the needs and the money available. Then the contract was let to Walter Cardwell, a local builder, who built the high school addition. The building was completed the middle of May, so Arrow Craft is now housed in new quarters. "The building is beautiful," Mrs. Weaver wrote me. I replied, "I hope it will be as comfortable and efficient as it is beautiful." Those are the three things that we had in mind in the planning, comfort and efficiency for the staff, and an adequate and beautiful building to attract the traveling public and display our products in such a way that no one will go away empty handed. The old Arrow Craft building now houses the wood and metal crafts, and the Voorheis building will take care of the high school weaving, one class room, the boy and girl scouts, and other high school activities. As well as constructing and equipping the addition to the high school and the new Arrow Craft building, attention has been given to keeping all buildings on the place in good repair, a room has been added to the hospital, much painting has been done, new equipment added where needed, and a chlorinator installed to insure the purity of the water. The new furnishings for the living room and director's room in Teacher's Cottage, as well as the attractive and efficient equipment of the home economics laboratory were made possible by funds from the sale of the cook books prepared by the Los Angeles Club. A summer recreation program was added last year and is being continued this summer. The cost is borne jointly by the School and the Community. Ever alert to keep the wheels running smoothly with a staff of twenty-five for these three branches of our work is Eunice Sheldon Weaver, Illinois L. She watches the community contacts and shows the many II (1) and other visitors over the place. She advises Mr. King and Mr. Price and the other teachers about school affairs and meets with the county board when necessary. She is always at P.T.A., Weavers' meetings, Garden Club, Church and Community affairs. She calls on the sick and keeps in touch with the older people of the community. In fact she seems to be everywhere. I wish I had time to write in full an appreciation of every member of the staff. There is our efficient bookkeeper, Frances Brown, Missouri r, who, in addition to keeping an intricate set of books, finds time to assist Mrs. Weaver and any-one else who needs her. Annette Morse, Illinois A, has been with us two years and does an excellent job of house managing and house mothering the THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 77 dormitory boys and girls. Under her supervision are the two local women who do the cooking and the school girls who do the cleaning, serving, and dishwashing. Three fine, attractive, and efficient Gatlinburg girls assist in Arrow Craft, Lura Owenby in weaving and Edna and Bess McCarter in the shop. I mentioned but I did not say half enough about Miss Georgia who runs our shop in the Mountain View Hotel. She sells the School with everything she sells, and her friends are legion. She is also one of our best community and church workers. These are the members of our staff and I have not praised them half enough. From Mrs. Weaver to Ambers and Arlie who are the faithful men who do the manual work about the place, the staff are ever working for the success and the proper functioning of the School. Back of the staff are the five members of the Settlement School Committee. Appointed by the Grand Council for a term, now lengthened from four to five years, they make the plans for the School and see that they are carried out. The main part of this is done at an annual meeting in the summer. Then for a week reports are heard, recommendations are considered, the budget made, county and state officials interviewed, local contacts made, and finally decisions reached. Being on the Committee does not mean just a nice trip to Gatlinburg, although I'll admit that is enjoyed, but long hours of intensive work at the meeting and a great deal of thought and attention during the rest of the year. Each member of the Committee has a specific job. Ethel Hogan Copp, California r, is our fine secretary and is ready to help clubs and chapters to find "Ways and Means of Raising Money." She, with the chairman, has charge of the Convention program. Irene Eldridge, Wisconsin B, is treasurer. She takes charge of all income from alumnT and actives. She checks the work of our bookkeeper at the school, reports to the Committee and Council each month, and makes an annual report to the Fraternity, published in the Information ARROW. Jeffries Green Pace, Virginia A, has done an excellent job as editor of News from Little Pigeon, and Marie Bacon :Magee, Missouri B, has taken charge of the school film and other material for club and chapter programs. This past year the film has been sent to twenty-nine clubs and three chapters. In addition to their specific jobs these committee members keep up correspondence with each other and the chairman, thus discussing and deciding questions that come up in the interim of the annual meetings. As Chairman of the Committee, in addition to the annual committee meeting I have made a visit of a week to ten days at the school each winter in order to see that policies are being carried out and to advise and assist the director and other members of the staff. This past winter I made an extra trip in order to help with the final decision on specifications and the letting of the contract for the new building. I have kept in close touch by letter with Mrs. Weaver and other members of the staff, with the Committee and ,Grand Council, attended to general correspondence, and sent two News Letters to clubs and chapters. I was an official visitor to the Delta Province Conference. Back of the staff and the committee are the members of Grand Council, one of whom is se lected by the committee as adviser. During my term of office the adviser has been our Grand President and her constructive criticism and her helpful advice have been greatly appreciated at all times. . . . Back of the staff, the committee, and the Grand Council stands the Fraternity. Without the interest and the support of the alumni and active members of II B ,1) there would be no Settlement School. Without the Settlement School the motivating power of an altruistic project would be lacking in the Fraternity. The school needs your financial assistance as well as your interest. For your loyalty and your generosity, we thank you. The staff and the committee know the difficult work that you do in raising money and we want you to know that it is not expended without great thought and care Even with the expanded program there has been very little increase in the total budget which is about $23,000. Between $11,000 and $12,000 comes from alumni. Of the $2,000 chapter contributions three-fourths goes into the endowment. $3,153.20 was received from the Magazine Agency and our thanks go to Beatrice Purdunn for her efficient management, as well as to all chairmen. The treasurer's report in the Information ARROW will give you further information on receipts and expenditures. That report will also give you the present status of the Settlement School Endowment fund and of that report we are proud. Four years ago there was still $13,042 due the school endowment fund from the school operating fund. This so-called "debt" has been a matter of some controversy in the Fraternity. It was incurred in 1928 when a portion of the principal of the school endowment fund was used to pay for the high school building and, as its use was against the national rules, our auditors have carried it on the books in this way. Each year this debt has been reduced until this year it has been paid in full. Our endowment fund now stands at about $44,000. The addition to the high school and the new Arrow Craft Building are entirely paid for and there are no outstanding bills or debts. Twelve trips to Gatlinburg have made me feel almost a resident. Visits to the school rooms, assembly periods, the Future Farmers, the Home Economics Club, the Girl Scouts, school parties and entertainments, all have helped me to know the pupils, their zeal, and their aspirations. Visits to the Weavers' meetings, the Garden Club, the P.T.A., and to the homes have given me an under-standing of the parents of these children, and the appreciation that they feel for the opportunity that B sl. is giving to their children through the school. They are grateful too for the economic help of the handicraft work that makes it possible for them to clothe and feed these children and for the health work that makes healthy bodies for these active, developing personalities. I shall always cherish my remembrances of Aunt Lizzie, my visits with Mom Profit, Cordie McCarter, Lula May Ogle, Izora Keener and many, many others, the walks up and down the street, stopping to talk to Steve Whaley, Squire Maples, Wiley Oakley, and the Huffs. Always there was some expression of gratitude to the Fraternity. The opportunity of knowing these people cannot be shared by all Pi Phis but helping to make their lives fuller and assisting in giving their children </p>

       <p>78 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW opportunity to develop their minds in sound bodies can be shared by all. The reward in satisfaction is unbounded. Again may I express my appreciation to all who have worked with me. Whether on the staff, the committee the Grand '-'-'Ctihcil, or just as a club or chapter member, if You have done your bit, be assured it has meant much in attaining the results set forth in this repOrt. It ,is a satisfaction to turn over my work as chairman to Marie Hagee who has worked so -faithfully and efficiently as a committee member 'for the last four years and I bespeak for her your continued interest and assistance. You and I and Other, Pi Phis have made an investment in Gatlin burg throughout the years. It has cost much in thought, time, energy, and money. It has paid well in the development of the mountain boys and girls, in making the lives of a once isolated people easier and fuller, in improving the health of a whole community, and reviving and developing the crafts of early days. Our work is not finished. Even though a concrete highway and neon lights have come to Gatlinburg, our mountain people still need our help and there is an almost unlimited possibility for future development in our educational work especially in the field of arts and crafts. LILLIAN BECK HOLTON EPO T OF THE *I ECTO \ OF THE. P1 BETA PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL, 19394940 Community ~SIgTH the moving of the post office from uire Maples' old building to more convenient and comfortable quarters farther west on the highway, came a lengthening of the business district of Gatlinburg; and still farther west, beyond the park line, is the new park administration building. The new Arrow Craft Shop has contributed much to the artistic appearance of the town. Fortunately for us, the Garden Club selected for this year's project of beautification, property owned by the school, opposite the new shop, and at the club's request, the state planted dogwood trees along the highway through the town. To some who visited the Burg years ago, and loved the rural atmosphere, it is something of a surprise to find a thriving tourist town. The growth has come, principally, from being head-quarters for the National Park. Arrow Craft's two shops get their just share from the sales to the many tourists. The Men's Club is now the Chamber of Commerce. The Public Library has been incorporated. The new postmaster, Elder Ogle, was once a pupil in the Settlement School. The Weavers' Play, Store Britches, written by Lula May Ogle, and organized by Gene Redding, has been revised and has two complete casts. Directed by Charles Palmer, it is being given every Tuesday night in the gymnasium. It is a perfect picture of life in the mountains in the days gone by. The P.T.A. organization has furnished the hot lunches for grade school children during the winter; prepared by a competent cook. They bought a new cook-stove and dishes for the lunch-room. All this from rummage sales and benefit entertainments. Cooperating regularly with the church, outstanding staff members were Veryl Elder, who led B.Y.P.U. meetings, Ben Fleming, who was superintendent of a Pigeon Forge Sunday School, Pern Price, who led the singing for all services in the Baptist Church, and Mrs. Georgia Duffield, who taught the Women's Class. During the last month of school, Ben Fleming acted as principal, and Josephine Fleming taught some of Mr. King's classes during his absence of three weeks due to illness. Some of the teachers feel there has been a marked change in the attitude of the students toward their studies, since electives have been introduced into the curriculum, and a marked in-crease in the achievement. Standard intelligence tests were given to freshmen. The State Department of Education urged the Tennessee high schools to adopt the self-evaluation program, de-signed to assist the teachers in forming the best plan for meeting the needs of the school and for attaining the goals set for those schools. Over a period of years, this should prove successful, the students receiving training to fit their needs and desires. The Grace Coolidge Library has been classified and entirely catalogued. Each class was given a three weeks' course in the use of the library. There are now 1,860 books. This year, with aid from the state, eighty dollars ($80) worth of non-fiction books were purchased. Some fine books of fiction, gifts from II 4 alumnae were received. Some new equipment was added. Mr. King said, "There was a stimulating atmosphere; the library became a center." Every boy took part in athletics of some description. Basketball, coached by Ben Fleming, was the most popular. Girls played softball. There were fourteen (14) in the graduating class, and all had a plan for the coming year. On Class Night, Bonnie Trentham's tribute to II B was very fine. Sevier County raised the salaries of the elementary teachers from eighty-five dollars ($85) to ninety dollars ($90) per month, after January 1. In April, the County Board voted to furnish an-other salary for next year. We will then have eight (8) teachers in the elementary school. The state furnished text books for the first three grades. After November, Pauline Morris replaced Mattie Huff Lawson in the second grade. How glad we were to have 100 per cent rating in sanitation and health by the State Public Health Department. Adding gradually as we could afford it, the list of equipment required for this rating, we only needed this year individual lockers, all THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 79 weather walks, more white paint on the walls of one room, stronger light, and exchanging rooms for two grades. In following out the instructional program laid down by the State Department of Education, Mr. Price, principal, left nothing undone to raise the standard of the school. A set of Compton's Pictured Encyclopedia was purchased by the children with proceeds from their carnival and ten dollars ($10) from the Little Pigeon Alumnae Club. Many children's books were received from II (I) alumni. Filing cabinets for the principal's office, and chart-easels for primary grades were made by old boys in the handicraft room, during vacation. Quite an innovation was the last thing added: an RCA radio-phonograph, bought by the children, with help from the Little Pigeon and San Jose clubs. Weekly programs sponsored by the State Department of Education were enjoyed. There were records of singing games, folk songs, and minuets; excellent for recreation and an appreciation of good music. The children enjoyed it, but a few of the parents at first did not approve of dancing. Gifts of playground and athletic equipment were received. One interested visitor, seeing the little boys playing baseball with very dilapidated balls and bats, sent a big box of new ones. Ben Fleming has been supervising the summer playground activities. Four boys in the upper grades showed little promise of ever learning to read or write. They were taken in hand by Ruth Parker, first grade teacher, one-half hour every morning, and on Saturdays. By the close of school, all four could read and write. I think the whole school was happy over this accomplishment. The Christmas entertainment was, of course, the great event, with nothing left out. The tree, the singing, the play by the smaller children, their exchange of little presents, the gifts from the clubs and chapters, all combined to make a happy day. Agriculture Since our vocational agriculture course, taught by Mr. William Coe, is based on the needs of the community which the high school serves, instruction has been given to four different groups: the eighth grade boys, high school boys, out-of-school youth with no occupation, and men who are now in the business of farming. The out-of-school group consisted of a class in a CCC camp, mostly from Sevier County. The seventy-nine (79) farmers in different communities were taught in the evenings. The instruction given to each of these groups was based on the farming done in their respective communities. For example, Pigeon Forge boys were taught hog raising, corn, small grains, and forage crops because the fathers of these boys are interested in such things. Perhaps the best way to record a year's work for a student is to read a letter from a freshman, Sherril Huskey: "I am planning to be a farmer. A boy must learn how to care for soil and livestock and how to plant and harvest crops. "Before enrolling in the freshman class of agriculture, I knew very little about farming compared to what I have learned, in just one year in the class. I have learned how to improve the soil on my home farm, by rotation of crops and keeping livestock to feed my grain and hay crops to, and by growing clover crops to prevent soil erosion, and for pasture. "I have learned to select a good type and breed of hogs, dairy cattle and chickens and how to feed and take care of each one. "Another important thing .we have studied is keeping farm records. Through keeping these records, we learn what enterprises we lose, and what we gain on. We made several field trips in which we got some practical experience in pruning orchards, castrating pigs, and selecting dairy cows. Each boy carries on a farm program to get practical experience and make money for his schooling. "I learned how to make my lawn more beautiful, and plant trees in my yard for shade." "Signed: SHERRrL HUSKEY" We had some very bad luck with poultry: the loss by fire, of the brooder house and 235 chickens, but we were thankful that the 550 baby chicks that were shipped to us by mail, arrived a day late because of the cold weather, and thus escaped the fire. Not all of these chickens belonged to the school. Some were for Future Farmer's projects. In the fall, some neighborhood dogs killed sixty (60) chickens. After one of the dormitory boys shot one dog, we had no further trouble from that source. Mr. Coe has made a survey of 100 farms in the vicinity of the Settlement School. From this, it is hoped we can determine more accurately, their needs and be better able to fill these needs through the boys in the classroom and on the farms, Home Economics The home economics course under Rosalie Ellis, followed out the state program for vocational work. The girls had a choice between handcrafts or home economics. For the past two years, weaving for sophomores has come under this department, and was taught by Gene Redding. There was a greater interest in the foods classes. The girls especially enjoyed serving dinners to which their parents or friends could be invited. They prepared and served the faculty Christmas dinner, a dinner for the basketball team, and one .for the Parent and Son banquet for the Future Farmers, which was attended by eighty (80) people. By having donations from the homes of the farmer boys, the banquet was managed for seven dollars ($7.00). The third year class had for a project, the planning and buying of all equipment for a log cabin lately purchased by Mr. Coe. Little striped sport jackets, designed and woven by third year girls were pretty and fashionable. One of these was worn at the Open House at the Home Economics department of the University of Tennessee, when two of our girls exhibited costumes they had made, in the style show. During the past two years quite a little work has been taken up in connection with the agriculture classes. Etiquette was one subject and proper foods another. Miss Jessie Harris, U cl, Dean of Home Economics at University of Tennessee, brought seventy (70) of her seniors to visit our department in March. The Home Ec Club sent three delegates to the state meeting at Nashville. Field trips were made to a large bakery and a packing company in Knoxville. In order that Arrow Craft should maintain its position at the top in Gatlinburg, among the rapidly growing handcraft shops, it was necessary to have larger and better planned quarters that </p>
      <pb ref="arr5710075_0004" seq="04" n="80-81  "/>
       <p>80 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW would centralize the weaving interest. The new building was financed entirely from Arrow Craft profits. It stands on the site of the old shop and is unique in style of architecture. It houses the salesrooms, stockrooms, toilet rooms, and the offices of Mrs. Ethel Snow, manager, and Gene Redding, weaving supervisor. After the old shop was moved last October to within fifty (50) feet of the high school building, it was closed. Business was carried on through the winter in the stockroom of the Voorheis building. In March, business was resumed in the old shop, but in spite of the signs pointing the way, shoppers did not seem to find the old shop where it had been moved in the back yard, as it were, and _there was a falling off in sales. But, on May 22 the new building was ready for occupancy, and the doors had hardly opened, when the buyers ap ,hpeared and business picked up. The volume of shipping for the year was about as usual, though club sales were not as much and returned articles numbered more. Mrs. Snow has listed the ten best sales and calls them here honor roll. Gene Redding found it necessary to place larger orders of yarns, and far in advance. Raw flax advanced 150 per cent since the outbreak of war, and although we have enough for a normal program, the next few months, we must conserve our supply while war lasts, ordering only what we can sell. Aunt Lizzie Reagan, frail, and eighty-three years old, is weaving her jeans material, for which there is a great demand. She was more anxious than anybody to move into the new building. At the Knoxville Fair, Arrow Craft weaving was given forty-five dollars ($45) in prizes. Two new movie films have been taken for the school by Jerry McCutcheon. One shows weaving being done at the school, and the other shows views of class rooms, buildings, and grounds, in color. Kappa Province Active Chapters and Alumni Clubs have expressed their desire to present, in memory of Nita Stark, a gift to the new Arrow Craft building, amounting to $300. The gift has not yet been selected. Handcrafts "The State Department," said Mr. Seeley, State Supervisor of Trade and Industrial Education, "looks upon the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School as being an ideal set-up for handcrafts." He gave his consent to our plan for a vocational course in handcrafts, though there was no precedent for the kind of course we wanted, in the state. Temporary space was given to this department, in the southeast side of the Voorheis Building, and Mr. William Oakes; craft teacher, recommended by Mr. Seeley, arrived August 1. He built a partition, shelves, work tables, cabinets for tools and installed the necessary machinery, amounting to $740. A stock of materials such as wood, aluminum, copper, brass, and pewter, was bought and all was in readiness by the opening of school. High school classes were held in the morning, adult classes in the afternoon and evenings. Due to the advance in the price of metals, less metal work was done after Christmas. The place was crowded, and it was considered a very good move when this department was taken to the old Arrow Craft building. There in the stone fireplace will be a forge so that articles of wrought iron may be made next year. We hope to offer for sale next year, a great deal of the students' work, and all hope that there will develop from this department, some real artists. jennie Nicol Health Center Having had a village doctor for three years, we missed him sorely after his departure last November. Duties fell more heavily upon the nurse, Marjorie Chalmers. Dr. Mittelman, graduate of the University of Michigan Medical College, came to Gatlinburg in April and has been very successful. Aid for our work has come from many sources. Glasses have been fitted and paid for by the Sevierville Lions Club. The American Legion stands ready to help crippled children. Dr. Bag-well, orthopaedic surgeon in Knoxville, is giving treatment to two cases. We have been provided with surgical dressings by the Washington, D.C. Alumna Club, baby clothes from the Franklin, Indiana club. Orlando club made possible the new sterilizer and thirty-five dollar ($35) fund for medicine. We have been placed on Sigma Phi Gamma's list for a grant of fifty dollars ($50) for medical use. With Mrs. R. E. Creswell, R.N., as leader, group of women interested in home nursing, was organized and had its meetings in the Health Center through January and February. Mrs. Creswell said, "The benefit which one woman alone received from this course, would have justified the work of two months' instruction." One out-standing example was the bed-side care Laura Trentham was able to give her daughter through a long illness of chorea. Another, the care that Lucinda Ogle gave her sister through child birth. They hope to continue the home nursing class next winter. During the extremely cold weather some families who lived in poorly-built houses, really suffered with cold, and sickness followed. Two babies died with pneumonia, and two adults. Grade school children were examined by a state dental hygienist, and some corrections made as a result. Health talks were given and Dr. Byers, County Health officer, showed moving pictures emphasizing the prevention of tuberculosis. This was followed with tests for probable cases. Only three (3) out of eighty (80) high school students tested, showed positive reaction. By the side of the cup won by the elementary school with three consecutive years of County Health awards, stands a new cup of this year's winning. For five years the Settlement School has stood first among the county schools in this con-test. Our usual custom of sending baskets and pro-visions to needy families and where there is sickness at Christmas time, was carried out and due to the generosity of some of our clubs and chapters, we had plenty of things to put into the baskets. Dormitories In Stuart Cottage, the boys' dormitory, seven out of the eight boys were vocational agriculture THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 81 students and were good helpers with our farm work. Some did janitor work in the school houses and assisted Arlie Watson with the general work of keeping up the grounds. The double shower that was built in Stuart Cottage has been a great convenience for the boys. In Pollard Cottage, the girls, numbering seven, attended to the dining room work and the cleaning up of all cottages. This was supervised by Annette Morse, who has been in charge for two years. With the help of the two cooks, she has fed us well and been patient with our likes and dislikes where meals were concerned. Just before Christmas, the kitchen range which had seen much hard wear and repair, seemed too far gone for mending. A new one was bought during the Christmas vacation. The kitchen floor was covered with new linoleum, and extra wiring was done so as to eliminate the difficulty with laundry attachments. Offi ce In her position as bookkeeper, Frances Brown has kept the accounts for Farm and Dormitories, and Arrow Craft, with the addition this year of " general handcrafts. Outside accounts were: P.T.A., Alumnae Club, and Old Timers a full program, well one. In closing I want to express for all of us at the Settlement School, our appreciation and our thanks for the faithfulness of clubs and chapters in their support of the School. Our demands upon the time of our chairman and members of the Settlement School Committee have been many, this past year, with its building program. We are grateful for their patient cooperation, and for the never failing attention given us by the Grand President and officers who have ever in mind the interests of the Settlement School.

WEAVER PI ET PHI SETTLEMENT SCHOOL EPO T ON AUDIT OF T EASUIE S ACCOUNTS YEAR ENDE JUNE 30, 1940 I iii 1, 1 August 30, 1940 To the Settlement School Committee, Pi Beta Phi Fraternity, Office of Settlement School Treasurer, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. DEAR MESDAMES: We have examined the records maintained by the Treasurer of your Committee for the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1940. With the data drawn from these records we have combined the report prepared by Homer K. Jones and Company, Public Account-ants, from the subsidiary records kept for the School and its Arrow Craft Shop, at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and we submit herewith the resulting attached statements. In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and related statements of income and surplus pre-sent fairly the financial position of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School at June 30, 1940 and the income and expenses for the fiscal year, subject to the ex-tent of our own verification, which as indicated above, did not include the Gatlinburg records. We examined and tested the income from club and chapter contributions which are shown in de-tail in Schedule 3-a and from magazine agencies and we found adequate support and authorization for the expenditures made directly by the treasurer. The cash balances at Milwaukee were verified by us. The endowment securities and cash, except cash in transit, were certified to by the Harris Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago, Trustees for the endowment funds, and this Trustee's report was accepted without further verification except that we proved the accounting made of security changes and income from securities. COMMENTS Cash Balances $14,978.24 The cash balances at June 30, 1940, exclusive of endowment income cash with the endowment Trustees, consisted of the following: Milwaukee Accounts: First Wisconsin National Bank Treasurer's general checking ac count $ 8,665.09 First Wisconsin National Bank Treasurer's savings account 1,029.89 Gatlinburg School Accounts: Sevier County Bank General check ing account 14.77 Sevier County Bank House account 160.12 Gatlinburg Arrow Craft Accounts: Sevier County Bank General check ing account (overdraft) 168.33 Hamilton National Bank Savings ac count 3,098.26 Morris Plan Bank Savings account 2,113.44 Foreign checks held by Grand Treasurer 10.00 Petty cash funds Gatlinburg 55.00 Total $14,978.24 Accounts Receivable $9,260.37 The accounts receivable arising from Arrow Craft sales were listed in detail in the report of Homer K. Jones and Company; it appeared that they consisted principally of Alumni Club balances and were considered by your employees to be generally collectible. The open balances of $9,260.37 represented an increase of $3,882.92 over those for June 30, 1939. None of the accounts were </p>

       <p>82 THE SEPTEMBER ARROW charged off as bad debts during the year under review. Inventories-$Z3,802 .89 The inventories at Gatlinburg, which we did not verify, totaled $23,802.89 as compared to $21,939.95 at the close of the previous year, an increase of $1,862.94. The inventory consists largely of finished stock, the supplies and materials amounting to $7,601.70. Fixed Assets Additions to the building and equipment ac-.--counts during the year 1939-1940 totaled $12,454.08 as indicated in Schedule 2. The actual expenditures totaled $330.00 more than the above --figure but adjustment was made to eliminate the book value of an automobile which was traded in. The principal addition was the new Arrow Craft Shop which was constructed at a cost of $10,731.67. Endowment Funds During the year under review the debt of the Settlement School to the Endowment fund, which at July 1, 1939 amounted to $5,596.86, was entirely repaid. This was accomplished as follows: Paid out of School funds on hand $ 500.00 Paid out of Arrow Craft income 2,500.00 Contribution of National Fraternity . . . 2,596.86 Total $5,596.86 The above contribution of the National Fraternity is shown in Exhibit "C" in the income account. The endowment fund was augmented by three-fourths of the active chapter contributions, or $1,604.00, and was decreased by a loss on bonds of $75.00, making a net increase of $1,529.00 for the year. The endowment total at June 30, 1940 was $44,300.25 consisting of the securities and uninvested cash shown in Schedule 1. Income and Expenses Income of the Settlement School exceeded ordinary operating expenses, exclusive of capital expenditures, by $2,314.01 as shown in Exhibit "C." The operating expenditures included depreciation of $2,676.39 of which a substantial part may be attributed to the Arrow Craft buildings and equipment. The Arrow Craft industrial department earned a net income of $10,835.28 subject to depreciation, as compared to $8,879.45 for the previous fiscal year. The difference between the two years was principally due to the losses of $1,967.99 charged off in 1938-1939, the ordinary net profit being substantially the same. The total sales for 1939.1940 were $42,951.03 as compared to $40,458.57 for 1938-1939. Arrow Craft wages and salaries totaled $15,250.67 while completed articles purchased totaled $6,892.27.

You will hear about it in other reports and see it first hand, I hope. But aside from its loveliness it will make the business of selling and shipping Arrow Craft products much simpler. When Club orders come in next fall they should go out with the least amount of time and effort. Speaking of clubs, I have put the first ten on the 1940 honor roll, not that others have not worked just as hard and sold as high a percentage for their number of members. Honolulu comes first again with $781 and Sabin (Nita Stark) Club with $679. Third honor goes to another Island Club with $643 to their credit, An interesting point to bring out is that more than twice as much Arrow Craft goods was sold in Hawaii than by any one club in the U.S.A. Further listing gives Northern New Jersey fourth place with $588 and Houston a very close fifth with $575. Berkeley and Westchester vie for sixth and seventh places with $565 and $558. Berkeley has been a very active club this year with a tireless chairman and Westchester is always active. New York is eighth on the list with $512 and Washineton, D.C. and Denver ninth and tenth with $423 and $400 respectively. The two latter have had the same good chairman for a number of years and their interest has never lagged. Denver has been instrumental in other Colorado clubs getting their start in salesmanship. New York and New Jersey may certainly be proud of their sales record this year. The advertising for the New York City sale was copied in the Knoxville paper. I also know that Houston had some clever advertising as they sent me a copy, also a peppy chairman. The Northern New Jersey Club did not miss a chance to put a display of Arrow Craft products in the library for a month. All of these things help to bring our school and the great things we are doing for the adults of this community before the public. We have always been so proud of our Founders and they in turn can and would be proud of you for keeping alive a living memorial to them. With the war at its seeming worst it is impossible to make any prophesies for next year's business. The yearly report for Arrow Craft sales shows that almost one-third of all goods sent out returns to our shelves. This means that we have to weave at least one-third more than we think we can sell in order to keep up on club orders. To conserve for the future of the business there must be careful planning and careful buying of supplies by Arrow Craft and in turn careful ordering by the clubs. Respectfully submitted, ETHEL M.

       <p>THE SEPTEMBER ARROW JENNIE NICOL MEMO IAL HEALTH CENTE MAY 1939 MAY 1940 HE general trend of the work for the past year ['has been toward community nursing and prentative measures. The largest increase during at time can be traced to the lack for six months a doctor in Gatlinburg. A great many visits d some extra treatments were handled at the ealth Center that ordinarily would have been 'en care of otherwise. The office of Dr. Myron ittelman was opened April 1, and from the beaning, he has been quite busy. Dr. Mittelman is_ well trained, and his personality and symthetic interest are making him well received. Classes in home nursing were organized for )men, and although the weather was unfavorable, :endance was excellent. The group met at the spital during January and February, led by Mrs. E. Creswell, R.N. Discussions were lively and teresting, and it is our hope to have that service ain next year. Perhaps similar groups can be ranged in one or more of the rural districts in the mmer. Maternity and infant welfare work has about rubled over the figures for the previous year. any more women are coming for advice and neral check up early in pregnancy, and continue come for themselves and their babies. More keeping in regular touch with their doctors of which is very gratifying. The annual Blue Ribbon Contest won for B cf, a 100 per cent banner in sanitation, and st place in the large school class for the fifth nsecutive year. Last year, the big silver cup is won for the third time, making it the per-Lnent property of the school. This year, another the same size was placed in the cabinet, to be Id until another Blue Ribbon Day. During November, a state dental hygienist ex-tined all of the children of the Grade School, d because of that, more of them had dental :rections made. Tuberculin tests were given all the high school students, and only three positive actions resulted from eighty tests. Those three :Wren were given the privilege of having free !st examinations and x-rays to determine tether they had active or arrested cases of tuberculosis. The Sevierville Lions Club is sponsoring the ting of eyes, and provided glasses for four chil-!n of the district. Several othersthave been fitted I paid for their own. Sevier. County Post of American Legion is still helping to care for ppled children, and Dr. Troy Bagwell is treat-; four of our unfortunate ones. A few tonsil !rationswere performed, and more are planned the summer. We have had notice that our .nt for corrections from the Friends of Nfouna Children's Fund will be returned after a lapse of two years. Preventive inoculations have increased, and there were no cases of small pox or typhoid reported, and but one light case of diphtheria. Consequently, we have reason to be proud of the record in the prevention and correction of health troubles. Eighteen baskets were filled and delivered at Christmas time, and lists prepared for other groups wishing to share in that service. Many articles were loaned or given in time of need, and the toy cupboard and the reading shelf helped tide many a tedious hour. The exact use of the shabby old bag is still a mystery to some of our little folk, who find that it dispenses dressings, medication, and toys with equal facility. So far, they haven't found a baby in it, but they still have hopes. As always, one is at a loss to summarize the work of the Health Center. It is so intricately interwoven with the life of the community. The record of a home visit fails to portray the desperate battle with convulsions in the long hour before the arrival of the doctor, the steam kettle improvised to the sound of croupy breathing, or the forced feedings of a baby too weak to nurse, or the baby who died in my lap before we could get help. But there is much of joy in those figures, too. The happy and conscientious mothers, the clean and sweet babies, active and healthy school children. Then there is the girl, branded delinquent two years ago, who has now gained self respect and a good husband through understanding advice and a little material help. Though there are changes in the district, and people come and go, the Jennie Nicol Memorial Health Center still holds an important position in the life of the community. And it is our hope that it will continue to be of service, according to the standards set at the beginning eighteen years ago. Following is the summary of the year's work, in comparison with that of the previous one: Class of Work 1939-40 1938-39 Field visits 1,922 1,720 Office calls 2,349 2,849 Surgical dressings 2,106 2,334 Individual pupil inspections 2,140 2,286 Health talks and lectures . 128 120 Total typhoid shots 1,261 1,004 Completed typhoid series 400 332 Diphtheria immunization 67 60 Small pox vaccinations 170 159 Schick tests 78 76 Tuberculin tests 79 Other inoculations 302 251 MARJORIE CHALMERS, R.N. VING RTMENT, JUNE 1940 WE .\ s EP 1HERE has not been much change in the routine work of the weaving department during the year. We all realize that the move into the vbuilding where we will be under one roof .1 make our work more efficient and much ier. We have a larger supply of weaving materials on 'hand than is normal. I felt it wise to invest in a large supply of linens of all kinds because of the war situation that has reduced the imports to such a great extent. We have enough on hand to run us for about a year if we have no great increase in the business. I would recommend that the clubs be cautioned about ordering more THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 93 linens than they are reasonably sure they will sell in order that the returns will be kept down to a minimum and in that way save us from weaving extra stock with which to take care of the returns. We have substituted other materials for linen wherever possible and will continue to follow this policy until the supply becomes normal once more. If the war continues, wool may also be affected in the same way. The girls of the sophomore class showed more interest in the weaving course than those of previous years. We had to borrow one loom to get enough for each two girls as the class was large. As long as the present 9 weeks set-up is followed, we can carry on the class. It might be possible another year to start the class three weeks before Christmas and in this way cause less delay with my spring designing program. We have had a few less weavers this year. After investigation I have added three new weavers to replace some who dropped out. By regulating the weaving among the group and seeing that the most needy ones are provided with more weaving than some of the more fortunate ones, the work has been well distributed. They have been most cooperative and apparently satisfied. There was a total of eighty-six workers. In the eleven months ending in May 1940, they have made 2,461 calls at the weaving building office and I made 156 calls in the homes. The Christmas dinner party given for the weavers was a gala event. They thoroughly enjoyed getting it ready and then the party itself. It was made possible by using the prize money the weavers took on their weaving we entered in the Knoxville Fair for them. The play the Weavers' Guild is putting on under the direction of Mr. Charles Palmer during this summer season promises to be a successful venture. The weaving meetings continue to be one of their pleasures. This year we have tried to make them more educational by having several speakers. Lura Ownby has continued to give faithful and intelligent assistance. I am grateful for the ideas for new designs that are sent in by the many interested Pi Phis. I only wish it could be possible to use all of them but so many times they are not practical to work OUt. With the increase in the price of materials and the inadvisability of cutting down on labor costs, it is increasingly difficult to make the inexpensive articles that so many people desire. I am looking forward to my trip to the Pen-land Institute this summer and appreciate the opportunity given to me to attend their summer sessions for a few days. Respectfully submitted, WINOGENE B. REDDING ls^ P INCIPAVS ANNUAL REPORT, 193940 N THE life of a school as in the life of a nation, when things run smoothly there is very little of an exciting nature to report. This is especially true of our school this year. With an experienced staff of teachers, and a serious-minded and fairly studious student body, school started out in a business-like manner and continued to run smoothly throughout the school year. Curriculum. The course of study followed this year consisted of: English, four units; agriculture, three units; home economics, three units; mathematics, three units; social science, three units, natural science, two units; and handcrafts, one unit, which gave two high school credits. An advanced course in agriculture for junior and senior students was started with eight boys, and a similar class for girls in home economics with five girls enrolled. The new course in handcrafts started this year, was the most popular vocational course, enrolling six boys and fourteen girls. All the twenty students enrolled in handcrafts finished the year and received two high school credits. In addition to the high school students, over seventy-five adults received training in hand-crafts in the evening and afternoon classes. The handcraft shop was set up in one corner of the weaving building. Several small power machines were purchased: also a good supply of hand tools. The work in handcrafts consisted of woodwork, wood-carving, and metal work in pewter, copper, brass, and aluminum. Enrollment and Attendance. The high school enrollment on opening day was 104, the same as last year. Others, entering later, brought the total enrollment up to 114, three more than last year. Fewer students dropped out of school than in former years, and we finished the year with 105 on the rolls. The average daily attendance for the year was 101.4. This is the first time that our attendance has exceeded the 100 mark. (100 in average daily attendance is one of the requirements for an A grade school in this state.) Library. A great deal of improvement was made in the library this year. The library more than ever before became the center of the intellectual life of the school. The cataloging of the 1,860 books was completed. Sixty-five new non-fiction books were donated by friends. A new catalogue case, pamphlet file, picture file, bulletin boards, and several pictures, were added to the library equipment; all of which helped to create a pleas-ant and stimulating atmosphere. A Hi-Y club under the direction of Rev. Palmer was organized this year with sixteen members. This club included the boys who were not members of the F.F.A., and met a real need for these boys. The Glee Club led by Miss Ryan and Mrs. Chalmers did some fine work this .year. They gave programs the local churches and in Pigeon Forge. They also furnished the music for the commencement programs. The F.A.A. Club had the largest membership in its history, and with the Home-ec Club, furnished much of the social life of the school. The school socials were all well attended and enjoyed, with every student present taking part in the games. The Handcraft Club gave two chapel programs, and held regular meetings to foster the progress of handcrafts in this community. Fourteen high school students received $378.00 on N.Y.A. aid for work done at school this year. This fund enabled several students to remain in school. Commencement. Rev. O. L. Rives, pastor of the Gatlinburg Baptist Church, preached the baccalaureate sermon, and Dr. Fred Smith, Dean of </p>

August 21, 1939. In November the annual -'Stiidt, and Carnival show washeld in the high school gymnasium. The elementary school won -5,zt,tprIze for the best stunt. For the sixth consecutive year the elementary school has won the Blue Ribbon prize for larger schools, This makes four years that a loving cup has been won and at present we have two cups, (A school, to keep a cup permanently, must win it for three years in succession.) Through a gift to the school a new all-steel flag pole thirty-two feet high was purchased last summer for $4.76. It makes a much better appearance than the crooked wooden pole it re-placed. A lady in Gatlinburg gave to the school a play-house and slide that is suitable for smaller children. The Parent-Teacher Association purchased for us material to make four new see-saws to re-place the old ones that have been broken. All students were asked to bring from two to five pennies to pay for magazines. By this plan we were able to purchase seven magazines that were suitable for that particular room. Two new professional magazines for teachers were added to the list to make a total of five magazines for teachers. The new magazines were Progressive Education and Childhood Education. Progressive Education is suitable for teachers in the upper grades and Childhood Education for teachers in the primary grades. These magazines were purchased by the school and were required by the State Department of Education. A reading center with table and chairs has been provided in each room. Books are placed on the table suitable for pupils at that particular time. The State of Tennessee (Department of Education) furnished free textbooks for students through the first three grades. This has been a help as there are students who could not afford more than one set of books a year. Two easels have been added to the equipment of the primary rooms, making a total of three for the school. These are used for chart work and drawing by the students. At the beginning of the year the P.T.A. hired a competent director of the lunch room by increasing the salary previously paid. The work in the lunch room has been more satisfactory than any previous year as far as good food, sanitation, and supervision is concerned. The average daily attendance for 1938-39 was 245.59 and the total enrollment for this year was 308. The average daily attendance 1939-40 was 247.75 and the total enrollment was 319. This showed an increase in average daily attendance of 2.16 and total enrollment of 11. Average Daily Total Year Attendance Enrollment 1937-38 227.74 285 1938-39 245.59 307 1939-40 247.75 319 Because of the extremely bad winter and an epidemic of chicken-pox our average daily attendance was lower than would have otherwise been had there been a normal winter season. Because of the cooperation of the teachers and an excellent teaching staff I consider this one of the best years for this department. Only three of our teachers had not had teaching experience. Programs have been given throughout the year by the students. Each grade took month about giving programs for P.T.A. The big program of the year was an operetta, The Children of Old Mother Goose, given on April 11. About forty-five children took part in this program. C. PERN PRICE, Principal T OF VOCATIONAL HANDC 1939.40 REPO II,' AFTS TEACHE IN THE handcraft classes we had both high school pupils and adults. In the high school class we had twenty-one boys and girls and it was a trade preparatory class. Two vocational credits were given for the work. The boys and girls have taken a great interest in their work and made a number of things they could never have had, otherwise. Some have be-come very efficient in their work and plan on con tinuing as adults. They have worked in wood and metal; however, they prefer the wood. It would be impossible to enumerate the things made both in metal and wood. At one time this spring there were ten tables and five cedar chests under construction. I have enrolled ninety people in the adult class during the year. Some came only a few times, but many camy regularly. In the fall term, we had THE SEPTEMBER ARROW 95 three afternoon classes from 1 P.M. to 4 P.M. and three evening classes, from 7 P.M. to 9 F.M. I go one night a week to the CCC camp and have a class in woodwork. Many of these boys are from Sevier County. The equipment and tools are all in good condi tion. Only one two-foot rule was lost during the year. Comments I have from many people are: This course is the best thing that has come to Gatlin-burg. I would rather spend my time here than anywhere else. WILLIAM OAKES- HOME ECONOMICS EPA TMENT lg T His year we offered a third year course in Home Economics to any girl in the junior and senior class who wanted to take it. This class proved to be very successful, and we are planning on three years of Home Economics next year. There were forty girls enrolled in the three years of Home Economics. The freshman girls were instructed in personal grooming, the fundamentals of clothing, planning and serving breakfast and lunch, and the selection and care of furnishings for the home. The sophomore class studied food preservation, making a wool dress, planning and preparing a dinner, a six weeks' course in weaving and personal grooming, and the making of a summer dress. These girls had some real practice. in preparing and serving a banquet. At Christmas time they gave a dinner for the faculty. This spring they prepared and served a banquet for the basketball boys and one for the F.F.A. boys and their parents. The senior girls selected problems which they felt they needed. At times each girl might have been studying about something different. Some of the problems selected were: vocations for women, the nursing profession, the dinner unit, costume design, and special problems in clothing. The second semester each girl designed a striped waver material for a jacket and actually made the jacket in class. This spring the girls planned and pun chased all the furnishings for the Agriculturc Teacher's cabin. Besides the class work each girl selected three home projects to be carried on at home. Th( girls derive real experience and skill from thi; type of work. We have about fifty girls in the Home Eco nomics Club. We belong to the state and Na tional Home Economics Students Club Associa tion. We were able to send three delegates to the state meeting in Nashville. Our Home Economics Department has beet used for two years now, and we are still ver^, proud of it. Respectfully submitted, ROSALIE ELLIS \ DO M][TORIES, 1939.40 THE last year has been a very enjoyable one for the boys and girls in the dormitory. Every-thing has gone very smoothly. We had eight boys and six girls at the beginning of the year. Ita Watson joined us in November. Then in February we lost Charlotte Whaley because her family moved to Pigeon Forge, and she came to school by bus for the rest of the year. We have had special dinners at Thanksgiving, Christmas, Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, and on birthdays. We have entertained the school board, the faculty, and several visiting Pi Phis. I have re-covered the upholstered chairs in the girls' dormitory, and the cushions on the seats. I have also made forty pillow cases. This spring as we could dispense with comforts, I have washed the covers and replaced them, i worn. The wool comforts had been washed til the wool was matted, so all had to be sent out recarded, and now covers put on all of them. Summer is here with the canning season, an as a start we have made thirty gallons of stra'a berry jam; source of the berries being from ou own patch. Soon other fruits and the vegetable will be ready for us to can. We have had Miss Belle Lowe, and Mrs. Lux Hurst as cooks all year, and they are very capabl and proficient. One could not wish for bette help. Mertie Ogle, our reliable laundress, is sti with us. Respectfully submitted, ANNETTE MORSE EPO T OF THE VOCATIONAL AGRICULTU E T~EAc HOER, 1939.40 All Day Classes THERE were forty-one boys enrolled in Vocational Agriculture. Three classes were taught to this group. One of these classes consists of nineteen freshman boys; another class of fifteen sophomore boys, and another group of eight junior and senior boys is being taught. This has been my biggest year with Vocational Agriculture classes, and it is my hope that we can continue to grow. Of these forty-one beginning boys we have thirty-six who will complete the school yea This shows that 13 per cent more boys stayed school this year than is true of a year ago. The Future Farmers of America The Future Farmers Chapter has just complete what we think of as being our most successf year. Our membership is now a total of forty-o: and this organization has been a great value training boys to be good leaders and to practi </p>

Livestock and dairy cattle judging contest at the University of Tennessee. Evening School Classes Two night schools are conducted in two rural communities for those men who are established in the business of farming. One of these evening schools is held in the Laurel Grove Community which is located seventeen miles from the Settlement School. This is my third year of conducting classes with these particular farmers. In this community we meet together every other Wednesday night to discuss their problems and to try to solve them. The other evening school class was held at the Laurel Lick Community school House, which is located eleven miles from the Settlement School. The total enrollment in these two groups reached the number of seventy-nine. This part of my work I consider very interesting and my success with this group has met with favor, especially with Mr. Freeman, our state supervisor of Vocational Agriculture. Day Unit Classes This year did not meet with the eighth grade pupils directly in the rural school, but tried to work with the Rural Grade School teachers. I have tried to get teaching material on agriculture to these rural teachers. The purpose being to aid those eighth grade students in deciding on guidance in choosing and preparing for an occupation. Part-Time Classes This year one class is being taught at the CCC camp which is located five miles away from the Settlement School. One class is taught every Mon-day night. There are twenty-three boys in this class. The course is based on Pasture Establishment and Improvement; Vegetable Gardening; Poultry; and Agricultural Arithmetic. These boys are mostly Sevier County boys and for their future, most of them plan to be farmers. The CCC camp has constructed a modern brooder house, and a rock brooder. At present they have 150 baby chicks which they are feeding and caring for according to approved farm practices. The School Farm This year we had eight boys in the dormitory who did the work on the farm and janitor work in the school houses. Seven of these boys took vocational agriculture. These boys who stay in the dormitory and who are taking vocational agriculture are strictly farm boys. They are good members of our F.F.A. and are very efficient leaders in that organization. Last fall, our jerseys, poultry, hogs, and farm products were shown at the County Fair, in which we placed well. We were again awarded the Grand Championship with a Jersey heifer. We also had a grand champion with one of our Duroc Gilts. Our jersey herd is becoming looked upon by the Sevier County farmer as the best to be found in this county.

S. COE Committee OrtS EPO T OF COMMITTEE ON EXTENSION, 193940 THE work of the Committee on Extension for this year has centered itself quite largely around the two groups who will be presenting petitions for charters at this next Convention. Grand Council has given very direct attention to both groups. TI r at Lawrence College, with Mary Jane Hill, Missouri A, sent there to help the group in their organization, has made remark able progress. II B at Vanderbilt University has had Edythe Cale Thornton, sent from Indiana B, and Virginia Hindman, D.C. A, to assist in their organization program. Both Lawrence College and Vanderbilt University seemed to Grand Council to present excellent extension facilities. New groups manifesting an interest in II B have been A e Sorority, University of Miami; K 0 at Hofstra College, Hempstead, Long Island, New York; Z at Marquette University; and the Little Rock Alumna Club has requested consideration of the possibility of installing a chapter at the University of Tennessee. New interest has been manifested this past year in establishing a chapter at the University of New Mexico at Albuquerque, although no group has been formed with the definite idea of petitioning, so far as we know. Interested alumna~, as well as Alumnae Clubs, would find the committee most appreciative of intimate information regarding their estimate of these groups and their colleges as possible extension fields. We have continued to keep in touch with the situations at a number of the other colleges and universities who have contacted us in the past, so that no good opportunity, should it develop in these centers, would be overlooked. But here, as before, no fields have developed to such an extent that they seem to offer any additional opportunities for extension. These institutions are: Baylor University, British Columbia University, Bowling Green, Ohio, Buffalo University, Kansas City University, Lake Forest University, Louisiana Polytechnic Institute, McGill and Queens University, Marietta College, Texas Technological College, West Texas State College, Whitman College, and Willamette University. The same conditions as heretofore still maintain, that of overcrowded fraternity groups, already enough chapters in a particular section, or else the campus administration does not see fit to permit nationals to get started. This committee chairman acknowledges her appreciation and pleasure in the contacts and assistance given by Miss Onken and Mrs. Finger, as well as the alumnae and actives with whom she has worked during the past year. My hearty thanks to the committee members who have worked with me. Respectfully submitted, ISLA MCCAIN DONERT COMMITTEE ON SCHOLARSHIP, 1939.40 T HE COMMITTEE takes great pleasure in announcing a general improvement in scholar-ship for the year 1938-1939. The general average for the Fraternity is 25.69 out of a possible 40.00. Since 26.66 places any chapter in the upper third, this average comes very close to being an upper third average. It shows an improvement of full two points over the average for 1937-1938 and the committee is hoping that when the grades for 1939-1940 are released an even greater improvement will be noticed. Thirty-eight chapters showed a gain in scholar-ship while only thirty-two showed a loss. In addition the average gain for each of the thirty-eight was thirteen while the average loss was eight. Eleven chapters showed neither gain nor loss because most of them remained at the top. Forty-two chapters are in the upper third, a gain of seven over last year, and eight provinces have a general average over 26.66, two more than last year. The provinces are Alpha East, Beta, Delta, Epsilon, Zeta, Theta, Iota, and Kappa. Lists of the chapters are attached. Fifteen chapters showed an improvement of more than 13 points over last year. They are: Maine A Ohio Vermont A Columbia A Vermont B Michigan A New York t Indiana A Ontario A Nebraska B Pennsylvania 3 Oklahoma B Ohio B Colorado B California B The committee has written regularly each month to the chapters and many fine suggestions have been given. Some of the methods used for improving scholarship are study cards, competitions, awards, charts, individual conferences, mother's teas, date restrictions, and reports on cuts. The Fraternity is fortunate in having so many women able and willing to help the chapters with this problem. "Honors" were reported in the February ARROW. The committee regrets that it is still so difficult to get a complete report on these. Grades are released very late and Honors frequently not awarded until after the chapter scholarship chair-man has gone home for the summer vacation. When the awards are given to seniors it is often hard for the chairman to get the information and pictures in the fall. The committee will appreciate receiving notices of any honor awards from anyone who may know of them before the committee hears. The committee and the chapters have been most appreciative of Grand Council's action in awarding the scholarship ring to each chapter. They feel it has been a real incentive for improvement of scholarship. Rings have been sent to all but nine chapters. These will be sent later. Graphs on the scholarship reports were not published this year since the national chairman was ill during March and April. The committee wishes to express to Grand 97 </p>
