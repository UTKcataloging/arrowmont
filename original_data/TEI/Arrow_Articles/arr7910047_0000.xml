Dix 46 News from Little Pigeon Edited by Sarah Wild Gordon, Wisconsin A New Weaving Studio Is Dedicated The latest addition to the Settlement School facilities is a Weaving Studio which was completed in June, 1962, and dedicated in ceremonies on July 5, during the annual meeting of the Settlement School Committee in Gatlinburg. The spacious studio has been planned to accommodate thirty-six looms and allow adequate space for instruction, display and storage of supplies. Of special interest is the attractively decorated entrance room which features a stone fireplace between open floor-to-ceiling shelves. Adding to the warmth of the room are the handwoven hangings. This room is the Evelyn Bishop Memorial Room. It was furnished from contributions given in memory of Miss Bishop, head resident of the school from1918 until 1933, who died last year. A number of Gatlinburg residents joined the Committee and Settlement School personnel in the dedication program. Special tribute was paid to Miss Bishop by Weaving Instructor Gene Redding and Sue Huff Cox of Gatlinburg. The ceremony ended with the presentation of the keys to the house to School Director Marian Mueller by Chairman Russell. The 1962 Mountairzeer (high school annual) was dedicated to Pi Phi with these words: To the members of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity, whose courage and foresight have, for fifty years, demonstrated the finest attributes of a democratic nation."
