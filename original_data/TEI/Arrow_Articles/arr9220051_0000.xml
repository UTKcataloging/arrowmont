       <p>Arrowmont Day Dr. Frank Tranter, Ft. Myers, Fla., demonstrates macrame (90) Tri-Delt Karen Edenfield, shows off her weaving skills (91) while Mrs. Tranter, Delta Zeta, spins (92) Each has been a student at Arrowmont Memory . .. "In this big world it's nice to know you share a common bond with so many." Surprise . . . "How Pi Phi binds together so many people from so many places." The Art of the Craftsman Dr. Frank Tranter, Arrowmont Student "Arrowmont is a great and wonderful school. The student body of Arrowmont consists of people of all ages and all walks of life and they're there to learn and be shown about the handcrafts. . . . The list of instructors reads like a page in `Who's Who in the Craft World.' They work endlessly toward perfection, student achievement. The "I have a wall hanging that was bought at the Arrowcraft Shop in Gatlinburg. It's silk screen and hangs in my office and reads, 'Hit's better for folks' character to learn to do things with their hands.' That's the philosophy of crafts. . . . What he was talking about is that you are a part of what you have experienced. And we are learning that the more connection we have with things we do with our hands and Is the Bond people they are teaching, those craftsmen, technicians, are . . . producing the heirlooms that we'll be so proud of tomorrow. "This organization with its superior leader-ship, instruction, and service gives rise to some-thing we choose to call the spirit of Arrowmont. It's something that isn't easily defined, but it's there it's felt by all the students, it's in the air, it's everywhere. On campus, in the studios, in the dining area, the anticipation, the enthusiasm, the excitement exhibited bydevelopment of our minds, the better `character' we develop. ". . . We're learning that in our schools the best approach to learning is through the arts and through the crafts . . . Arrowmont has pioneered this right along . . . The people who experienced Arrowmont come away from there a different person. You cannot attend a summer session and be the same person you were when you went there. . . . There are things that happen to you through these experiences. Between the Peoples of the World the students is their response to this effort and hard work that's put forth by the great Arrowmont team." Mr. Neil Mooney, Arrowmont Student "Arrowmont is one of the finest craft schools in America today. I've had the pleasure of examining schools in England, Denmark, and making ,a comparison and Arrowmont stands right up among the best of them. " `Hit's better for folks' character to learn to do things with their hands.' Arrowmont is doing a marvelous job of this and they sure do need your support. Please continue it." Miss Sarah Ruth Mullis, Board of Governors ". . . The realization of why Arrowmont is a philanthropy really came to me when I was interviewing some of the students for articles At the speaker's table for Arrowrnont Night were Sarah Ruth Mullis, Board of Governors; Neil Mooney, Arrowmont student; Helen Deppe Vollmar, Chairman, Board of Governors; Dr. and Mrs. Frank Tranter, both annual Arrowmont students.

       <p>52 in The ARROW. That was a turning point for me talking to the art teacher who would share her knowledge with senior citizens to the social worker who would show her delinquent girls that they could create something beautiful to Dennis, a cerebral palsy victim himself who would return to L.A. to work with crippled children and probably the most moving of all to me talking to the occupational therapist who worked in a mental hospital. She explained how quieting and comforting it was for the mentally ill to work with pottery. . . . There were others who were there without a ecause' college students, hobbyists they were there because they wanted to create something lasting and of beauty. "The bond we're talking about tonight is the one of the craftsman, the one that binds Arrowmont students to each other but even THE ARROW OF PI BETA PHI more important, it binds them to others with whom they share their knowledge. Our students hold out their hands to hundreds and thousands of people in your community and mine, people they touch both literally and figuratively. "These craftsmen hold out one hand to others, but they hold out their second hand to you, and to Arrowmont . . . We ask you to offer one hand to Arrowmont and its students while with the other hand you turn toward home and grasp the hands of your chapter or club, thereby binding them also to the chain of those who care. In this way the bond of Pi Phi to craftsman to people everywhere is unending. There is no limit to the lives we can enrich, to the joy and beauty and caring we can spread." there were conferences at the podium . . . checks and double-checks on election day . . . 4 Ida Jane Spicer Sharpe, Chairman of the Tellers' CornSally Schulenburg, Central Office Director, and Evelyn mittee.
